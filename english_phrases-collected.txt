Let's have lunch sometime!
There's still so much more I want to talk to you about!
Let's definitely have lunch sometime!
Did you ever get a chance to look over that memo I sent you?
Oh, right!
Thanks so much for reminding me!
I'll get back to you on that soon.
Some are better than others
I do like my classes, but really I have to say that some are better than others.
He is quite the character
she is quite the character
You know her?
She is quite the character.
I don't know what to make of her.
Thank you so much!
Can you pass me the milk?
There you go.
Thank you so much!
Please send me the material by monday.
Here it is.
You might want to consider
You might want to consider to postpone your trip until after the deadline.
That's a great idea but 
So I really think that's a great idea, but you might want to consider the opposite approach.
Would you like some gum?
I'd like you to meet my friend.
What was your name again?
The most 
I just watched the most depressing movie.
Good job!
Please write down 5 names of people you know.
Good job!
You did really great.
So we're done with your X-ray, you can get up now.
You did really great.
Fooling around
Sounds great
Can we meet on Monday at 3?
Monday at 3 sounds great!
How are you?
How are you?
Hi!
So good to see you!
I'll have to think about it
Would you be able to come pick me up before the game?
I'll have to think about that one.
A little
We probably want to take a cab there.
It's a little far
I don't want to go at all, it seems a little dangerous.
Awesome.
I think we have everything we need for the dinner.
It'll be an awesome event.
I'm really excited about being done with my tax forms!
Really?
That's so exciting to hear!
Let's just say
I'm a little unhappy with her work.
Not great
Not the best
We had to fire him because he wasn't the best programmer.
Not a good fit
Unfortunately, a convicted arsonist is not the best fit for our warehouse.
I wish I could
So are you coming over tonight?
I wish I could!
I love him, but
I love her, but
I mean, don't get me wrong
I love my boss, he's awesome.
But he keeps screwing me over behind my back, and he hasn't paid me in six months!
I'm not sure if that
I'm not sure if I would agree with him on that matter.
You know what?
I'm not sure that he really cares about your opinion.
That's really interesting
You work for
Oh my god!
So my boyfriend, he has a band, and they're looking for an agent now.
Really?
That's really interesting.
He is nice.
She is nice.
So what did you think of him?
We just started dating
I think I really like him.
He's nice.
Totally.
Totally nice.
Stay in touch.
Keep in touch.
Keep in touch, all right?
Not bad
So tell me honestly
What do you think of my new painting?
It's not bad.
Still working on
Are you still working on that salad?
Yes, thanks.
I'll just leave this here then.
Whenever you get a chance
I'm all over it
Did you start getting those reports ready?
I'm all over it!
I partied so hard last night that I could hardly get up to work today.
You should come to my party on Saturday.
There will be olives!
Probably not
I will probably not make it to the party tonight.
A huge favor
Can you do me a huge favor and pass me the salt?
It's not that.
It's just that
It's not that he's an idiot, it's just that I don't feel comfortable when he opens his mouth.
I'm totally going to write her a letter.
For you
Let me just have a look at this chart for you, sir.
No offense but
No offense, but let's just say that your new book is not as great as your previous ones.
Not necessarily
So do you think the board took my idea badly?
Not necessarily.
Mixed success
You know, bringing you to meet my parents was met with mixed success.
Highly recommended
It is highly recommended that you turn in your application in time to increase your odds at being considered.
For your own safety
For your own safety, please do not congregate around this car crash victim.
Cozy
I love my new apartment.
I just don't know if two people can stand in it together.
It's a bit cozy.
That could be good.
How about we all go to the movies?
That could be good.
Are you sure you want to do that?
I think I'll just call her and tell her how I really feel.
Are you sure you want to do that?

Really awful.

Really good!
Pretty uneventful.
Very productive.
Super busy.
A total nightmare.
Did you like the movie?
It was fantastic.
It was terrible.
It wasn't bad.
It's one of the best I've ever seen.
No, I didn't think it lived up to the hype.
This means the movie was not as good as its publicity presented.
How was the party?
It was absolutely packed.
It was a good time.
Small, but fun.
There was hardly anybody there.
Boring
I couldn't wait to get outta there.

I'd be glad to.
Will it take long?
Sure.
Just a second.

Let's go see a film.
Why don't we go out tonight?

Yes it is.
But it still looks good.
Do you take good care of it?
Oh, yes.
I wash it once a week.
Do you change the oil?
My mechanic changes the oil twice a year.
Do you have a girlfriend?
No, I don't.
Do you?
I don't have a girlfriend either.
Why not?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm not rich enough.
Girls like guys with money.
They sure do.
They like guys with new cars.
I don't have money or a new car.
Me neither.
But girls like guys who are funny.
Maybe we should learn some good jokes.
Where are you going?
I have to walk the dog.
What kind of dog do you have?
I have a little poodle.
Poodles bark a lot.
They sure do.
They bark at everything.
They never shut up.
Why did you get a poodle?
It's my mom's dog.
So she likes poodles.
She says they're good watchdogs.
Can I borrow $5?
Sure.
Why do you need it?
I want to buy lunch.
Where's your money?
It's not in my wallet.
Your wallet is empty?
I don't have even one dollar in it.
Being broke is no fun.
Even if it's only for a short while.
It's always good to have friends.
Friends will lend you money when you're broke.
As long as you pay them back.
Let's go to the beach.
That's a great idea.
We haven't been in a while.
We haven't been in a month.
The last time we went you almost drowned.
No, I didn't.
Then why did the lifeguard dive into the water?
I think he wanted to cool off.
He swam right up to you.
And then he turned right around.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we should get going.
Are you married?
No.
I'm divorced.
When did you get divorced?
I got divorced two years ago.
Why did you get divorced?
My wife left me.
Why did she leave you?
She said she didn't love me anymore.
Wow!
That's terrible.
Yes, it was.
Why didn't she love you anymore?
She fell in love with my best friend.
I'm bored.
What's on TV?
Nothing.
There must be something on TV!
Nothing that's interesting.
What about that new game show?
Which one?
Deal or No Deal
Tell me you're joking.
I love that show.
I watched it once.
That was enough.
It's on right now.
Let's watch it together.
I like living here.
I agree.
Pasadena is a nice city.
It's not too big.
And it's not too small.
It has great weather all year long.
It has the Rose Parade.
It has beautiful houses.
It has wonderful restaurants.
It has great schools.
It's close to the mountains.
The people are friendly.
I'm not ever going to leave.
We need a new mattress.
What's the matter with this one?
It's not comfortable.
It seems fine to me.
I toss and turn all night.
You should stop drinking coffee.
Look at these marks on my arms.
What are they?
They are bites.
Did the cat bite you?
No.
The bedbugs in that mattress bit me.
OK.
Let's get a new mattress.
My laptop is so slow.
Buy a new one.
I would if I had the money.
Why is it so slow?
That's a good question.
Did you take it to a computer shop?
I would if I had the money.
I guess you have to live with it.
Sometimes I want to throw it out the window.
You don't want to do that.
Why not?
You might hit someone in the head.
What's for dinner?
I'm not sure.
How about a pizza?
You had pizza for lunch.
But I love pizza.
Everybody loves pizza.
So why can't I have pizza for dinner?
Because you need variety.
Different things
not the same thing all the time
You mean like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?
No, I mean a salad instead of a pizza.
We need to save money.
Why do we need to save money?
Because we need to buy a house.
But a house is so expensive.
That's why we need to save money.
How much do we need to save?
We need to save enough for a down payment.
How much is that?
Thirty thousand dollars!
That will take forever.
Not if we save every penny.
OK.
Here's seven pennies.
The ocean is so big.
You can't see the end of it.
It goes on and on forever.
And it's deep, too.
I think it's five miles deep.
Are there fish at the bottom?
There are fish at the top and the bottom.
Are there more fish or more people?
I think there are more fish.
I hope so.
I love to eat fish.
I'm upset with my mom.
Why is that?
I warned her about her new boyfriend.
She didn't listen to me.
What happened?
I gave her $1,000 for her birthday.
I told her to spend it on herself.
That was very nice of you.
I found out that she gave it to her new boyfriend.
Why did she do that?
He said he would buy her a nice ring.
What's wrong with that?
He went to Las Vegas.
He lost it all gambling.
I hope your mom broke up with him.
Do animals talk to each other?
Of course they talk to each other.
What do they talk about?
They talk about other animals.
What else do they talk about?
They talk about food and the weather.
Do they talk about us?
Of course they talk about us.
What do they say about us?
They say that we are funny looking.
We're not funny looking.
I have to clean the house.
Yes, it's very dirty.
You can help me.
Why me?
Because you helped make it dirty.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to clean the bathroom.
Oh, that's easy.
Clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet.
That's a lot of work.
Tell me when you finish.
I don't think so.
You'll just give me more work.
You're watching too much TV.
What do you mean?
I mean you're wasting your life.
I'm having fun.
You're sitting there with your mouth open.
Who cares?
I care.
Do something.
OK.
I did something.
What did you do?
I turned up the volume.
That's not what I meant.
Will you do something?
Leave me alone.
Did you write a letter to grandma?
Yes, I did.
Did you tell her about school?
I told her that school is fun.
Did you put the letter in an envelope?
Yes, and I sealed the envelope.
Did you put a stamp on the envelope?
I couldn't find any stamps.
They're in the kitchen drawer.
OK.
I just put a stamp on the envelope.
Give me the envelope and I'll mail it for you.
When is grandma going to learn about email?
Why are you yawning?
I'm sleepy.
Why don't you go to bed?
I want to watch this TV show.
Maybe you should record it.
The tape recorder is broken.
Then you should watch the rerun.
Why?
I'm watching the original.
But you'll be asleep in about one minute.
I'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
OK.
I'll tell you how the show ends.
It's Sunday.
So?
You know what that means.
I forgot.
Sunday means we go to church.
Oh yeah.
Put on a coat and tie.
Why?
To show respect to God and others.
I'm glad Sunday is only once a week.
I hope God didn't hear that.
He'll forgive me.
Did you feed the cat?
I'll do that in a minute.
The cat is meowing.
He's hungry.
OK.
I'll feed him right now.
You shouldn't make him wait.
I was doing my homework.
The cat doesn't care about your homework.
The cat doesn't care about anything.
That's the way cats are.
All they think about is themselves.
Maybe we should get rid of him.
Of course not!
He's family.
I hate shaving.
Me too.
I just cut myself again.
Did you use a new blade?
It doesn't matter.
Maybe you should use an electric shaver.
They make a lot of noise, but they don't give a close shave.
Maybe you should stop shaving.
And grow a beard?
Sure.
Why not?
Because food and other stuff sticks in my beard.
Hmm.
Here's an idea.
Put cream on your face and have the cat lick it off.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Are you reading this paper?
Oh, no.
Help yourself.
I asked because the paper is sitting next to you.
Thank you.
That's polite of you to ask.
Some people would just pick it up.
Yes, I know.
Some people are rude.
I always try to be polite.
So do I.
The world needs more polite people like us.
I agree 100 percent.
I want a puppy.
Let me think about it.
Why do you have to think about it?
Because a puppy costs money.
No, it doesn't.
Puppies are free.
Yes, but a puppy needs shots.
Shots for what?
So it won't get sick.
Just like you get shots.
I hate shots.
And a puppy eats food.
Food costs money.
No problem.
I'll give him food off my plate.
Oh, no you don't.
Puppies don't eat vegetables.
Look at all these kittens!
How many are there?
Eight.
They're all so cute.
Yes, but I can't keep them.
What are you going to do with them?
I'm going to give them away.
Do you want one?
Yes, I would love one.
Which one do you want?
That one.
The one that's all black.
Yes, I like that one, too.
I'll call him 
My parents go to church every Sunday.
They trust in God.
They hope they will go to heaven.
They probably will.
But no one knows for sure.
That's for sure.
No one knows what happens after we die.
If we are good, we will be happy in heaven with God.
That's what many people believe.
If we are bad, we will be unhappy forever in hell.
I don't want to go to hell.
Let's go to church with your parents on Sunday.
My husband died.
I'm sorry for you.
Thank you.
When did he die?
A couple of months ago.
You still miss him.
Yes, but I talk to him almost every day.
When you go to church?
When I call him on his cell phone.
What do you mean?
I buried him with his cell phone.
What will you do when the battery dies?
Today is Friday the thirteenth.
That's a bad day.
It's supposed to be unlucky.
You're supposed to stay home all day.
That's what I do.
My friend stayed in a hotel on Friday the thirteenth.
That was a mistake.
He stayed on the thirteenth floor.
What happened?
Someone stole his laptop.
He was asking for it.
He learned his lesson.
He's home today.
Do you really love me?
Of course.
Prove it.
How can I prove it?
Take me to dinner.
That's it?
That's all I have to do?
Take me to a nice restaurant, not to McDonald's.
But a nice restaurant costs money.
Yes, and you have to make a reservation.
That's such a hassle.
I knew you didn't love me.
OK, OK!
I'll make a reservation right now.
My parents are divorced.
So are mine.
Why did your parents get divorced?
My father found a new girlfriend.
That's too bad.
My mother was hurt and angry.
She had good reason.
What did she do?
She told him to drop his girlfriend.
What did your father do?
He moved out of our house.
I guess he really liked his new girlfriend.
Yes, but she left him a year later.
My grandma's apartment smells funny.
So does mine.
I think it's an old people's smell.
Really?
Yes.
I think when you get old, you begin to smell.
Like fruit that is too ripe?
Yes, just like fruit that is too ripe.
But the smell is different.
Old people don't smell like fruit.
They smell like a thrift shop.
Yes, a thrift shop has that same smell.
Yes, an old smell.
The price of stamps goes up and up.
I think stamps used to cost a penny.
That was a long time ago.
It was before I was born.
Now a stamp is 42 cents.
But in May it will be 44 cents.
Have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
No, I haven't.
Neither have I.
They do a good job for the money.
Yes, they do.
Maybe we shouldn't complain.
A button came off my shirt.
What are you going to do?
First, I have to find the button.
Where did you lose it?
I have no idea.
A button is hard to find.
Did you look in your pant cuffs?
That's a good idea.
I found a button in my pant cuffs one time.
Let me look.
No, it's not there.
Many shirts come with an extra button.
You're right.
This one does have an extra button.
Now all you have to do is sew it on.
I have to go to the bathroom.
You drink too much coffee.
But I love coffee.
Well it's your life.
You eat too much chocolate.
I don't think so.
Have you looked in the mirror?
Do you think I'm getting fat?
I didn't say that.
What did you say?
I said I have to go to the bathroom.
That's what I thought you said.
Did you do the laundry?
Yes, I did.
What did you wash?
I washed the sheets and towels.
What about the pillowcases?
I took them off the pillows and washed them.
Did you dry everything in the dryer?
I dried everything in the dryer.
Then what did you do?
I folded all the towels.
Did you put the sheets on the beds?
and I put the pillowcases on the pillows.
Do you listen to the radio?
I listen day and night.
What do you listen to?
Mostly talk radio.
What's that?
People talk about current events.
What do they say?
They say they want change.
What kind of change?
They want tax cuts.
Why do they want tax cuts?
Because tax cuts will save them money.
I'm hungry.
Look in the fridge.
I'm looking.
There's nothing to eat.
Are you sure?
It's almost empty.
I went to the market yesterday.
I don't see anything.
I bought lots of oranges and apples.
I don't want fruit.
I want something tasty.
Eat the fruit.
It's good for you.
Next time you go to the market, let me go with you.
No, thank you.
All you want to eat are hot dogs and candy bars.
What is there to eat?
I don't know.
Look in the fridge.
I think I'll make a sandwich.
What kind?
A ham sandwich.
The bread is in the cabinet.
Where's the mustard?
It's in the fridge, I think.
Oh, yes, here it is.
Do you want a sandwich?
That sounds nice.
How about some potato chips?
Yes.
And a pickle, if we have any.
It's time for your bath, young lady.
I'm not dirty.
You need a bath every day.
Why?
Because you don't want to smell bad.
I don't smell bad.
That's what you think.
If I smelled bad, I could smell me.
I can smell you.
I can smell you, too.
That's my perfume.
When can I wear perfume?
Something's wrong with my computer.
Exactly what?
All I get is a black screen.
What's the matter?
I think I know, because this happened before.
What happened before?
My hard drive crashed.
Oh no.
That's bad news.
It sure is, but I'm going to call them first, just to make sure.
Will you lose all your files?
I always back up my files.
You're smart.
I called HP about my computer.
What did they say?
They said I need a new hard drive.
That's too bad.
How much is a new one?
It's not too much, only about $85.
Plus installation?
My hard drive is easy to remove and replace.
Really?
It's just a couple of screws.
That's nice.
It's a lot better than paying someone $60.
If my hard drive crashes, I'll just call you.
What's your email address?
Are you sure that's all?
Yes.
No.
That's incomplete.
What do you mean?
What's your mailing address?
That's correct.
So what's the problem?
You have to give me the city, state, and ZIP code.
Oh, I get it.
My email address is 
I'm going to take a nap.
You should unplug the phone.
That's a good idea.
Do you want me to wake you in an hour?
No thanks.
Just let me sleep until I wake up.
I'll start dinner at 6:00.
OK.
I think I'll be awake by then.
If not, your nose will wake you up.
You mean I will smell the food cooking?
You might even dream about dinner.
I don't think I'm going to dream about anything.
I'm really tired.
Have a nice nap.
That was a nice funeral.
Yes it was.
The son gave a nice speech about his father.
It was long too.
I think it was about 45 minutes long.
But it went by fast.
It was interesting.
I liked it.
I'll give you a speech like that too.
Do you think anyone will come to my funeral?
Of course.
I think only the family will be there.
You have lots of friends.
They will be there too!
Yikes!
What was that noise?
I had to blow my nose.
Did you have to blow right next to the phone?
Did you hear that?
Of course I heard that.
I thought a plane had crashed into your house.
It wasn't that loud.
I will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see.
OK.
I'll take your word for it.
I thought you had an elephant in your house.
You're funny.
What did you say?
I think I've gone deaf.
I'm going into the bathroom to blow my nose.
I'll be right back.
I have lots of friends.
Really?
How many do you have?
I don't know, maybe one hundred.
That is a lot of friends.
Do you have a best friend?
Of course.
I have lots of best friends.
How many best friends do you have?
I think about twenty five.
Hmm.
I have only one best friend.
I feel sorry for you.
I have only a few friends.
You must be lonely.
I will share my friends with you.
That's very nice of you.
Don't you ever cheat on me.
Why would I do that?
Because men like to cheat.
Some men do, but not me.
I'm watching you.
I'm an open book.
Watch me all you want.
If I catch you, you'll be sorry.
You won't catch me, because I love you.
I'm not a cheater.
I will poke your eyes out.
I don't want any other woman.
I will chop your toes off, one by one.
Honey, please.
You're the only woman for me, forever.
I swear it.
I hate to go outside.
Me too.
Why do you hate to go outside?
I meet too many jerks.
I agree.
This city is full of jerks.
Rude people are everywhere.
But what can you do?
You can yell at them.
And they will yell back at you.
Yelling doesn't do any good.
No.
The best thing to do is just stay home.
Will you look at this form?
Are you having problems with it?
I don't understand some things.
Let me help you.
Use numbers.
I don't understand.
That's simple enough.
Always print clearly, and fill in the bubbles completely.
Let's go to the animal shelter.
What do you want to do?
I want to get a puppy for my son.
That will make him so happy.
I'll get him one of those little dogs.
One that won't grow up too big.
And eat too much.
Do you know which one he would like?
Oh yes.
I took him there yesterday.
He showed me one that he really liked.
I bet you had to drag him away.
He wanted to take it home yesterday.
I wonder what he'll name it.
What's the weather like?
I don't know.
I just woke up.
Why don't you look outside?
OK.
It looks like rain.
Why do you say that?
The sky is gray.
Is it raining right now?
No.
How do you know?
The street isn't wet.
I have to go shopping today.
You'd better take an umbrella.
I can't believe how hot it is.
It's not even noon yet.
That means it will get hotter.
I am dying from the heat.
Turn on the air conditioner.
It doesn't work.
What happened?
I don't know.
Did you call the repairman?
Of course.
When is he coming?
He's busy.
He said next week.
I'll be glad when winter comes.
Why is that?
Because I love the snow.
The snow is fun.
Last year we made a big snowman.
How big was it?
It was seven feet tall.
How long did it take?
It took us all day.
Did you give him a nose?
Of course.
We gave him a big carrot for a nose.
Let me help you make one this year.
I'm going to the bank.
What do you need to do?
I need to withdraw some money.
How are you going to do that?
I'll just use the ATM.
What's that?
It's the Automatic Teller Machine.
It gives you money?
I just insert my debit card into the machine.
And it gives you money?
It gives me money, but 
It's my own money.
Oh.
What good is that?
I thought it gave you free money.
Did you put the blue bin out on the street?
Oh no.
I forgot.
You'd better take it out front.
What time does the recycle truck come by?
It usually gets here at noon on Tuesday, which is tomorrow.
I'll just take it out to the street tomorrow morning.
Oh no, you don't.
What do you mean?
Every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
Do you think I'll forget to do it?
You'll remember to do it, but you won't have time to do it.
Ok
I'll take it out front right now.
Are you ready?
Ready for what?
Ready for the big switch.
What are you talking about?
The nation is switching to digital TV.
Oh.
Of course I'm ready.
Did you buy the converter?
I don't need a converter because I bought a digital TV.
How much was that?
It was only about $120 for a 13-inch screen.
Does it pick up any digital channels?
Oh yes.
I get six Korean channels but nothing in English!
People are funny.
They sure are.
Did you hear about the pilot?
The one that stole a small plane?
He stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U.S.
Did they catch him?
Yes.
After two U.S. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway.
Did he crash?
He just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant.
Did the cops find out why he flew into the U.S.?
His life sucked.
He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down.
Poor guy.
The police need our help finding a robber.
How do you know?
The TV news is reporting a bank robbery.
Do they know what the robber looks like?
He's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.
What race is he?
They didn't say.
The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.
Of course not.
That would be racist.
But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
Don't ask me.
Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.
Don't wipe your nose on your sleeve.
But I don't have a tissue.
Then go find a tissue in the bathroom.
I didn't have time to get one from there.
Your sleeves are not tissues.
But Mom, all my friends use their sleeves.
That doesn't make it right.
I saw Dad wipe his nose on his sleeve yesterday.
I will talk to your father about that.
I bet Dad did it all the time when he was my age.
Your daddy was a good little boy.
How do you know?
Were you his mommy, too?
I'm worried.
Worried about what?
I'm getting married.
You should be happy, not worried.
I am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
You have to take care of your wife.
And I have to take care of our children.
Are you going to start a family?
Yes.
We want to have a little boy and a little girl.
That sounds wonderful.
Except we can't afford it!
No wonder you're worried.
I don't get art.
Or artists.
They're in a different world.
I saw a painting of a jar that was full of pencils.
The artist said the jar was both full and empty.
But it was full of pencils!
How could he say it was empty?
Artists see things differently.
Did you ever see anything that Picasso painted?
Of course!
He's world famous.
Did he ever take art lessons?
I can't believe it.
I drew paintings like that in third grade.
Where are they?
Maybe they are worth millions.
What's the point?
The point of what?
Of living.
Who knows?
You live, and then you die.
We must be here for some reason.
Maybe we're here to have fun.
Then why aren't I having fun?
Because you're thinking too much.
So I should stop thinking?
Stop thinking about what the point is.
OK.
I'll start thinking about having some fun.
Just be patient.
Fun doesn't come along every five minutes.
Beer is a powerful drug.
So are cigarettes.
Which would you prefer?
What do you mean?
When you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.
I could pick only one or the other?
Yes.
Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.
Boy, that's a tough one.
What's so tough about it?
Of course
I would pick cigarettes.
But cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.
Well you can't have everything.
I don't think I want to go to your heaven.
My pants have a hole in the front pocket.
You shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.
Yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.
Lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.
Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?
Criminals, of course.
Anyway, I have to fix the hole.
You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.
Tell me about this patch.
The patch has glue.
The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
That sounds a lot easier than sewing.
It is.
But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.
Do you know any good jokes?
I can't remember jokes.
Neither can I.
They go in one ear and out the other.
Who makes up all these jokes?
Who knows?
But there must be a hundred new ones every day.
Yes, just in English alone.
I wonder if every language has jokes.
Of course!
People everywhere like good jokes.
What do you think people joke about the most?
I think most jokes are about women.
Oh really?
I think most jokes are about men!
You're very lucky.
Why do you say that?
You speak two languages.
Well my English isn't perfect.
No one speaks perfect English.
Maybe I will be the first!
I've been thinking about learning Spanish.
Spanish is easy.
I'll be happy to teach you.
How long will it take me to learn?
I think it will only take you a year or two.
How soon can we begin?
Ahora!
That means right now.
Do you know what today is?
It's more than just a date.
Is it your birthday or anniversary?
What's that?
It's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
Oh, you mean like reuse things and recycle stuff?
Yes.
We need to think green, save water, and stop using plastic bags.
How about if I take shorter showers?
That's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.
From now on I'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.
Poetry sucks.
I don't know anyone who likes it.
Some of it is OK, I guess.
The poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
But people still write poems.
No one makes any money at it.
Shakespeare was a poet.
Did he get rich from his poetry?
Probably not.
Poems are a little bit like songs.
Yes, but songs have music.
Without music, songs would suck, too.
How smart are you?
I don't know.
I think I'm average.
Did you ever take an IQ test?
No, I never did.
All I know is that I got A's and B's in school.
I wish I was really smart.
Don't be ridiculous.
What do you mean?
If you're going to make a wish, wish that you were really rich or famous.
Don't you ever wonder what it's like to be super smart?
It must be very lonely.
Why's that?
Because if you're super smart, no one understands what you're saying.
I missed the TV news last night.
What was on?
Nothing that would pass as news.
What's the weather going to be like this weekend?
I don't know.
Whenever the weather comes on, I switch channels.
What was the lead story on the news?
Some actress was in court for driving without a license.
What was the second story?
Some actor married a woman young enough to be his daughter.
What was the third story?
A bull chased a man in a supermarket.
Wasn't there anything about her?
Of course.
She's going to hire a nanny for her eight infants.
What are you going to do about your death?
Well mostly I'll try to avoid it.
I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
My wife and I will be cremated.
Are you going to be buried next to each other?
Oh, no.
Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.
You're not going to be buried?
A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.
Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.
Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.
That's true.
A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.
We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.
Did you wipe your feet?
Of course I wiped my feet.
Then why is there mud on the carpet?
I don't know.
It's not my mud.
Someone brought it into the house.
Look at the bottom of my shoesthey're clean.
Of course they're clean.
You left all the mud on the carpet.
I'll get the vacuum cleaner.
Don't vacuum it now.
Don't you want me to clean up the mud?
Wait till it dries.
It will be easier to vacuum.
Next time I will be more careful.
What are you getting for your mom?
What are you talking about?
Sunday is Mother's Day.
This Sunday?
Of course.
It's all over the news.
I thought it was next Sunday.
You'd better get her something.
I'll get her a nice card.
Is that it?
Yes.
That's all I ever give her.
She raised you, and all you ever give her is a card?
It's OK.
She knows that I love her.
I don't like our flag.
What's the matter with it?
It's too much like other flags.
A lot of flags have stripes.
A flag should be pretty.
What should our flag look like?
It should have a pretty woman on it.
That's ridiculous!
You don't like pretty women?
Of course I do.
But not on our flag!
Every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
You can't go to war carrying a flag with a woman on it!
I had a busy morning.
What did you do?
I watered all the plants.
You have a lot of plants.
Then I did my laundry.
That takes some time.
I took the dog for a walk.
I'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
I vacuumed the entire house.
That's a lot of work.
And then I made lunch.
I'll bet you were hungry!
I don't have long distance service with my home phone.
So how do you make long distance calls?
I use a calling card.
Where do you get that?
I buy it at the dollar store.
How much is it?
It's one dollar for 100 minutes.
That's only a penny a minute!
It's a great price.
But you have to dial a lot of numbers.
How many?
First you dial seven numbers, then ten numbers, then ten more numbers.
Yikes.
I think I’ll keep my long distance service.
I'm concerned about my son's grades.
Would you like us to schedule a conference with his teachers?
Yes, that would be great.
We'll go ahead and schedule the meeting.
Will you call me when it has been set up?
Yes, I'll call you tomorrow and let you know what time.
I'm mostly worried about his English grade.
I'll make sure that his English teacher is present.
He did rather well in math.
If his math teacher can't make it, that's OK.
I'll try my best to notify all his teachers.
I can come to a meeting any day except Thursday.
All right.
I won't ask them to come on Thursday.
I want to do what I can to help my son.
We're all trying to help him.
He's having trouble with English.
I know that.
I see him struggling with it.
His teacher tells me that he turns in homework late.
It's very difficult for him to finish it on time.
What can we do to bring up his grades?
For one thing, he should turn in all his homework.
Has he missed any assignments?
Yes, he has.
Last week he failed to finish a book report.
Oh, dear.
I didn't know that.
I would like to have a copy of the assignments.
Here's a copy of all the assignments.
I wish I had this list earlier.
It's not too late for him to improve his score.
What exactly is his problem in your class?
He makes a lot of effort, but English just isn't easy for him.
So am I.
I think your son has a lot of ability in math.
I'm mostly concerned with his English class right now.
Although you want to bring up his English, I think he could also improve in math.
He should get an ‘A'.
I'd like to help him in math, but I'm not very good in math myself.
That's all right.
I know he needs to improve in English.
I don't want him to get behind in his English homework.
Certainly.
But when he's caught up, I'd like to give him extra credit work in math.
I'm sure he would enjoy that.
The extra credit work will help him with his final exam.
He gets a little nervous during exams.
How was the meeting with his teachers?
It went very well.
It was important to get to know his teachers.
Did they suggest ways we can help him?
His English teacher recommended we hire a tutor.
That's a good idea.
But isn't it expensive?
At the school they have a list of tutors that are reasonable.
You haven't written your book report yet.
I'll write it tomorrow.
But you and your friends are playing soccer tomorrow.
I'll write the report tomorrow night.
But you will be very tired tomorrow night.
All right.
I'll start writing it tonight.
Will you help me?
He hasn't done his math homework yet.
He usually leaves it to the last minute.
I've already spoken to him twice today about it.
All right.
I'll go talk to him.
Maybe I can help him with his math.
His teacher said that if he gets stuck he can call.
I'll try helping him first.
If we can't solve it we'll call his teacher.
The piano movers just called.
They can't come today.
Oh no.
We have to move the piano today.
We'll have to move it to the other room ourselves.
We can't move it ourselves.
It's much too heavy.
We'll have to try.
I know.
We'll put the rug under it.
Good idea.
Then we'll slide it into the other room.
We were successful.
We moved the piano.
Now we have more space in the living room.
The problem is, we have less space in the dining room.
The dining room is a good place for the piano.
I'm not sure.
The trouble is, the piano needs work.
That's true.
The piano is kind of out of tune, isn't it?
There's one other little problem.
There's a leak in the stove.
I smell gas in the kitchen.
Then we have to call them right away.
Will they come over and fix it?
Usually they fix gas leaks.
I'm fairly certain.
I didn't know that because we've never had a gas leak before.
Are there any other problems we need to discuss?
I don't know about you, but I'm annoyed by the neighbors.
You mean the noise they are always making?
Yes.
They play their stereo at two in the morning sometimes.
I think we should talk to them about it.
What should we say?
We should ask them politely to turn off their stereo after 10:00 pm.
I don't know if we'll ever solve all our problems.
What now?
Somebody parked their car in front of our house.
Oh, you're talking about the blue car.
It's been there at least a month.
That's right.
And it's very dirty and messy.
I'm sure that someone has abandoned that car
That's what I think.
What should we do about it?
We should report the car to the police.
What will the police do about it?
First, they'll put a warning notice on the car with a deadline for removing it.
And if the owners don't remove it, the police will tow it away?
Yes, and we need to get rid of it soon.
We have too many books and CD's and no place to put them.
I know, I'll build some book shelves.
It's not hard.
Here's a design for a nice bookshelf.
It's in Sunset Magazine.
Our bookshelf needs to be larger than that one.
You're right.
We need a place to store all these magazines.
We need to take a trip to the lumber yard and the hardware store.
Didn't you say you were going to build a bookshelf?
Yes, I remember thinking about it last weekend.
You haven't built it yet.
I know.
I haven't gotten around to it yet, but I will.
When do you think you might do it?
I just haven't had the time.
I've been at work too much.
By the time I get home, I'm exhausted.
After we build the shelves, it would be nice to plant flowers.
Where would we plant flowers?
The front yard is concrete.
But there's dirt under the concrete.
We just have to break the concrete.
That's really difficult.
I don't have the energy to do it.
It's no problem, really.
The concrete is probably thin.
Probably thin you say.
But you don't know for sure.
Isn't it wonderful?
We should celebrate.
Celebrate?
I'm too wiped out to celebrate.
But look at all we've accomplished.
We moved the piano.
We got rid of the abandoned car in front of the house.
The neighbors are finally quiet after 10:00 pm.
And we have flowers in the front yard.
Did I forget something?
You never built the bookshelf.
Hello.
I'm detective Robinson of the San Francisco Police Department.
Nice to meet you.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Someone was murdered in this neighborhood.
I'm sorry to hear that.
How can I help you?
You might be able to help the investigation.
I'm happy to answer any questions you have.
Did you hear a gun shot around 8:00 this evening?
I heard a loud noise.
But it sounded like a firecracker.
What were you doing when you heard that shot?
I was washing dishes, and my wife was writing a letter.
Were you walking on the street at any time this evening?
No, I don't think so.
Wait.
I might have gone to the corner to buy a paper.
You might have gone to the corner to buy a paper?
Yes.
In fact, I remember now, I went out around 7.
That's fifteen minutes before the murder occurred.
I suppose so.
But I didn't hear anything on the walk.
You said you heard something like a firecracker.
Yes, when I was washing dishes, I heard a firecracker.
And when were you washing dishes?
I was washing dishes around 8.
Yes, I'm sure of it.
When did you return from the store with the paper?
I got back from the store at 8.
I looked at my watch.
Now, just a moment.
Let me get this straight.
You left at 7 to get a newspaper.
That's right.
I like to read the paper after I wash the dishes.
And you got back from the store at 8.
You looked at your watch.
Is this investigation going to take much longer?
Sorry to bother you.
Give me another couple of minutes.
Because I have a lot of work to do tonight.
I understand.
But solving this murder is important.
My favorite TV program is on tonight.
Last week it was canceled because of a wrestling match.
I enjoy watching wrestling matches.
I look forward to that program every week.
I avoid watching wrestling.
The violence upsets me.
You don't like violence, however you own a gun.
I own a gun?
What gave you that idea?
I did a little research before this visit.
There is a gun registered to your name.
Here's a copy of the form.
Yes, as a matter of fact, I own a gun.
However, I fire it rarely.
May I have a look at your firearm please?
Yes.
It's right here in my pocket.
But I don't know why you want to look at it.
It's a little warm.
Why is it warm?
It feels warm to me.
I've been carrying it in my pocket, that's why.
Are you trying to tell me that your pocket is warm?
Yes.
Here's my wallet.
It's warm too.
I don't know what you're driving at.
I'm simply trying to get to the bottom of this murder.
Well maybe you should take your investigation somewhere else.
I'm getting bored.
Are you?
I thought you enjoyed murder investigations.
I'm feeling nervous all of a sudden.
All these questions.
How was it possible for you to wash dishes at 8:00?
It was very possible.
I used dish soap and a sponge.
But you clearly said that you were at the store between 7:45 pm and 8:10 pm.
Exactly.
I went to the store to buy a paper.
Why must I keep on repeating things?
And yet you were here washing dishes at 8:00 pm.
The very idea that I fired a shot and hit a young man in the back is absurd.
How did you know he was a young man?
And how did you know that he was shot in the back?
It's obvious that you have chosen the wrong man to investigate.
I did nothing wrong.
You have warm gun and you know certain facts.
I have eyes don't I?
I can see the street from here.
You were looking at the street when the shot was fired?
Absolutely not.
Why would I?
That's ridiculous.
I'm tired.
I don't feel like going to school today.
No wonder you're tired.
You stayed up until 2 am.
Can I sleep just a little longer?
I'll be on time for my 9:30 class.
This is the fourth class you've missed so far.
I know, but I can catch up.
He takes good notes.
You must not always rely on him or your other friends.
Why did you stay out so late last night?
There was a party at his house.
I didn't want to leave.
I was having too much fun.
Why did he have a party on a week night?
He wanted it because his parents weren't home.
His parents weren't home?
Were there any adults at this party?
No, there weren't any adults there.
That's why we had a good time.
I don't want you to go to a party unless
adults are present.
Did you drink anything?
I only had a couple of beers.
And I had a little vodka.
You must not go to his house and drink alcohol.
Promise me you won't do it again.
Before last night, I had never drunk so much alcohol.
Even though you have a hangover, you must get up and go to school.
All right.
I apologize for staying out late and drinking.
I'll stay home tonight and study hard.
You told me you were going to his house to study English.
You didn't say anything about a party.
What do you mean?
Didn't he come to school today?
He hasn't arrived at school yet.
His first period teacher reported him absent.
There must be a mistake.
He left for school a half hour ago.
He should be there by now.
Just one moment, I see his teacher now.
I'll ask him if he showed up.
You'd better shape up fast or I'm going to be very upset.
It's OK
He is here.
He was ten minutes late to class.
Ten minutes late?
Why was he so late?
He would've been on time if he hadn't missed the bus.
Why did he miss the bus today?
His teacher will mark him tardy, that's all.
How many times has he been late for his first class?
We have to sit down and talk about this.
I don't have time to talk right now.
I have to go to his house.
His house?
Is he having another party?
I'm going to his house to study English.
He is a good student.
He said he would help me.
But that's what you said the last time you went to his house.
I know.
I wasn't telling the truth.
I admit it.
I won't drink anything except water or soda.
Before you go over there, listen to me a minute.
I don't have much time to get ready.
You've been going to Steve's a lot.
You've been missing the bus and getting to school late.
All of that is going to change.
I'll do much better.
You haven't been doing your English homework.
You barely passed English last semester.
I know that.
I'm working very hard.
I read several pages everyday.
It is very important to do well in high school.
I have been listening to you for ten minutes.
You've been listening to me, but you haven't been doing the right thing.
Stop lecturing me.
Can't you leave me alone?
I want to be independent.
I want to do what I want to do.
If you get bad grades, you will damage your future.
Oh, all right.
I guess you're right.
I've decided I'm not going to Steve's.
I'll stay home and study.
Do you remember me?
Of course, you're his English teacher.
We met each other at the meeting we had last week.
Yes, I thought it was a very good meeting.
I'm happy to tell you that he got an ‘A' in his last paper.
I'm very pleased to hear that.
Thank you for calling.
I have a problem.
My aunt Sophie will be visiting me next month.
Why is that a problem?
She's your favorite aunt.
I don't have any space in my apartment to put her up.
Why can't she sleep in your guest room?
Have you seen my guest room lately?
It's full of junk.
You should have a garage sale to get rid of that junk.
Have you ever held a garage sale?
No, I've never held one.
I don't know how to do it.
For one thing, you have to advertise.
You can put an ad in The Chronicle or The Advertiser.
After I put an ad in the paper, then what do I do?
Make some posters and put them up on phone poles near your building.
Then a lot of people will come to my garage sale.
Exactly.
People read those ads all the time
They are looking for garage sales.
Do you think people will really buy this junk?
You would be surprised.
One person's junk is another person's treasure.
All right.
I'll do it.
I will hold a garage sale next Saturday.
Good.
I'll help you sell your junk.
And I'll bring some of my junk to sell too.
I'm looking forward to having this sale.
Don't act so nervous.
Let the people look over the items.
Shouldn't I go up to them and ask if they need help?
No, don't do that.
This isn't a store.
If they like what they see, they'll buy it.
I've never seen so many people at a garage sale before.
You did a good job of advertising it.
That's why there are so many people.
I stayed up all night making colorful posters.
How much do you want for this VCR?
I've been thinking about how much I want to charge.
One hundred dollars, I guess.
One hundred dollars?
That's too much money.
This is an old VCR.
It's a few years old, but it works very well.
Although I haven't used it for a while.
Can you please turn it on and put in a tape and prove to me it works?
I can't do that.
My TV is inside my apartment.
I don't want to bring it out.
If you can't prove to me it works, why should I pay $100 for it?
I told you that it works.
There's nothing wrong with it.
I still don't think I should have to pay $100 for it.
Why not?
What if I bring it home and it doesn't work?
Then I will have spent $100 for nothing.
All right.
Suppose I sell it for $50.
Will that make you happy?
What if I take it home, put on a tape, and it destroys my tape?
That won't happen.
I promise you, that won't happen.
But I can't know for sure it won't happen.
You refuse to demonstrate it.
All right.
I have to take care of other customers.
Tell me a price you are comfortable with.
I'll take it off your hands for $15.00.
That's all I have in my wallet at the moment.
Fine.
It's yours.
I hope you'll be happy with it.
What's this?
It's a lid for a sauce pan.
But I sold the sauce pan.
Why didn't you sell the sauce pan and the lid together?
I wasn't thinking.
I was so busy helping customers.
It might fit my sauce pan at home.
How much do you want for the lid?
Take it.
It's free.
I hope it fits your sauce pan.
How was your garage sale?
Was it worth while?
Yes, I'm glad I held one.
I made about two hundred dollars.
Great.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there to help you.
Something came up.
That's OK.
Actually, a couple of neighbors helped me out.
You said you made two hundred dollars?
But a lot of stuff is left.
I know.
I sold small items, mostly.
I still have a lot of junk.
Look at this shopping list.
Christmas is only a few weeks away.
You certainly have a lot of presents to buy.
I'd better go shopping today.
If I wait until the last minute, I won't find anything.
Why do have such a long list this year?
Last year your shopping list was a lot shorter.
My daughter married a divorced man.
He has six children from a previous marriage.
I wouldn't buy presents for all those children.
I have to buy presents.
I'm their only grandmother.
Do you know what the children want for Christmas?
I wrote a few things down in my notebook.
A dress, a dictionary, a wallet, a backpack.
These things could be expensive.
And you?
Have you done your shopping yet?
I've decided I'm going to buy practical presents
for my children and grandchildren.
Practical presents?
Things they can use at school, at home, and at work.
Your shopping list is as long as mine.
I'm accustomed to buying a lot of presents at Christmas.
Could you give an example of a practical present?
My nephew wants a new shirt.
But, I'm going to get him a bicycle helmet instead.
What do you suggest I buy my grandson?
He wants a toy train.
Buy him a pen and pencil set instead.
Of course, those things are practical.
He will use them at school.
I'm buying sheets and pillowcases for my daughter and her husband.
They're a lot cheaper than a new set of silverware.
Practical gifts are the cheapest presents you can buy.
Maybe we could pick up a bargain at a garage sale.
Don't buy Christmas presents at a garage sale.
You're right.
I've never found anything at a garage sale I've really liked.
I think you should buy your granddaughter an umbrella and a raincoat.
That's a good example of a useful present.
I haven't gone Christmas shopping yet.
Why not?
Do you realize that Christmas is only three weeks away?
I'm trying to think of practical gifts.
Do the children wash their hair and brush their teeth?
Have you heard of any one who doesn't?
You should buy them toothpaste, shampoo, and conditioner.
I need to buy some pillowcases and curtains.
Do you have those items?
No.
we don't.
You can find them in Household Furnishings on the Sixth Floor.
Could you tell me where I can buy CDs?
We don't sell CDs.
You'll find them in Tower Records.
Is Tower Records near here?
Tower Records is right across the parking lot.
Christmas is only a week away.
Haven't you finished your shopping yet?
Not yet, but I've completed about half of my list.
I think your daughter will like the curtains.
Your grandson will enjoy the CDs.
I'm having trouble finding a raincoat for my son in law.
A raincoat?
That shouldn't be difficult to find.
Did you check the Men's Department?
Yes I did.
The problem is my son in law is very short.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a raincoat for a short man.
Here are several short raincoats.
This one is nice.
These are nice raincoats, but don't you have any shorter ones?
No, I'm afraid not.
These are shortest ones we have.
Do you want to try the Children's Department?
Certainly not.
My son in law is a grown up man.
I'm sorry we couldn't help you.
Please come again when your son is a little taller.
I couldn't find a raincoat for my son-in-law.
And I don't want to buy him an umbrella.
What's wrong with this raincoat?
It's on sale.
It's too long.
It would drag on ground if he wore it.
I suggest you get him a Macy's gift card.
Then, he can buy his own clothes.
A Macy's gift card?
How much would it cost?
You can get a gift card for any amount you want.
We are happy to have Elizabeth Taylor here today.
I'm very happy to be on your program, John.
Tell me, Elizabeth, where and when were you born?
I was born on February 27, l932, in London, England.
How old were you in your first movie?
I was nine years old in the movie
There's One Born Every Minute.
You have acted with some famous performers.
I was in two movies with Lassie, the dog.
But your first big success was in 
It was a horse movie.
I won a horse race in it.
I've always loved horses.
You weren't just a child actress.
You became a famous adult film star.
That's right.
I wanted to be a serious actress like my mother.
Many child actors don't go on to be in movies as adults.
Sometimes an actor can only get roles if she is young and cute.
You earned an Academy Award twice, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
The first time I won I was surprised.
I didn't like the movie I was in.
And the second time?
I played an unhappy wife of a professor.
It was a good role.
May I ask you a couple of personal questions?
That depends on the questions, of course.
Have you ever been really in love?
Oh, what a question!
Yes, of course, several times.
Exactly how many husbands have you had?
I've had eight, including my present husband.
Probably your most famous husband was the actor Richard Burton, am I right?
Yes.
I met Richard when were playing in the movie Cleopatra.
You and he were very often in the newspapers and magazines.
Like many famous people, we were always chased by reporters.
We didn't have much privacy.
It can be very difficult to avoid photographers.
Although I tried to be nice, I was often angry at them.
You're 68 years old now.
How do you feel?
I've had several health problems, but now I'm OK.
You have done a lot of work for AIDS, haven't you?
Yes, I have.
It's a terrible epidemic.
And we need to find a cure for it.
Do you still act in movies?
I haven't been in a movie for a while, but I sometimes appear on TV shows.
Another of your famous husbands was Eddie Fisher.
Yes.
Eddie and I were married for three years.
Did you and Eddie have any children?
Yes, we did.
We had a daughter, Carrie.
She became an actress also.
I remember seeing her in Star Wars.
She was wonderful.
Yes she was.
I have several children and also grandchildren.
Your life hasn't been free of problems, has it?
No, John.
For several years, I had a drinking problem.
But, you successfully overcame that problem.
Yes, I did.
I used to drink a lot with my husband, Richard.
He never got over his drinking problem, did he?
No, he didn't.
In fact, he died of alcoholism.
When you have a strong addiction, you can't cure yourself.
You need to get help.
So, you found help and now you're better.
That's right.
I need all my energy for the things that are important to me.
For example, your fund raising for AIDS research.
That's right.
And also, my children and grandchildren.
You've certainly led a rich and exciting life.
Tell me, Elizabeth, what is your secret for remaining so beautiful?
Thank you for the compliment.
I think beauty is inside a person.
Really?
That's an interesting idea.
Yes.
If you are kind to people and if you have a good heart, it is easy to be beautiful.
It has been a great pleasure to have you on my program.
I enjoyed talking to you and your audience.
Tell me about yourself.
How long have you lived in San Francisco?
I've lived here about four years.
How about you?
I haven't been here as long as you.
I arrived two years ago.
A lot has changed in my neighborhood since I got here.
How long have you been attending classes at this school?
I've been studying English for the last two years.
I started studying English a week after I got here.
How do you feel about your progress?
I feel pretty good about it.
I've learned a lot in the last six months.
I haven't been able to come to class every day.
Neither have I.
My work schedule changes every month.
I didn't know a word of English when I first got here.
I had studied some English in High School before coming to the U.S.
My only English class has been at Mission Campus.
I'm not fluent yet.
I need more reading and writing.
Have you studied other languages besides English?
No, I haven't studied any other languages.
It's all brand new to me.
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
I have two older brothers.
They live in LA.
I go down there and visit them every now and then.
I haven't been able to visit my relatives in Canada.
It takes time and money to go on a trip.
Yes, it does.
If you drive, it takes a lot of time.
If you fly, it's expensive.
You have to be able to afford the trip.
It's not easy.
We seldom get two consecutive days off.
My brother Ray is working in computers in LA.
Really?
What kind of computer job does he have?
He's been repairing computers for quite while.
He's gotten several promotions.
My sister‘s husband is an engineer.
He makes pretty good money too.
I'm considering studying computer repair here.
Do they offer a program in repairing computers at Mission Campus?
Yes they do.
They have a certificate program.
Do they place graduates of the program in jobs?
Yes they do.
If you're interested in electronics, you should check it out.
I haven't had a chance to look into all the possibilities.
I was telling you about my family.
My brother Bill is a teacher.
My sister is a teacher also.
She teaches in grade school
How long has your sister been a teacher?
She hasn't been a teacher for a long time.
Only four years.
My brother has been a teacher for about that long.
My sister Anna hasn't been teaching for a year.
She's been taking care of her new baby.
Was she able to get a maternity leave?
Yes she was.
She'll be able to return to her job in a year.
I might have to go down to LA next week.
My brother is moving and needs my help.
How long do you think you'll be gone?
I might be gone for a couple of weeks.
Will your employer excuse you from your job?
He agreed to give me time off in exchange for extra hours.
I asked my boss for only a couple of days off, and she said she'd think about it.
It's a shame the boss is in such a bad mood.
I agree.
I wish she were in a better mood.
Me too.
I was hoping I could ask her for a couple of days off.
It looks like that's out of the question.
I wanted to go to Sacramento.
My niece is getting married there.
I wanted to attend her wedding.
The boss is under a lot of stress right now.
Will you be able to go to your niece's wedding?
The boss finally agreed to let me go.
That's great.
She really is a very fair person.
I know.
It's just that sometimes she's stressed out.
Right.
The best thing is not to take it personally.
I promised her that I'd do some work on the train.
What kind of car are you planning to buy?
I haven't decided.
Something economical.
I heard Toyota Tercels are economical.
They don't use a lot of gas.
How do they handle on the highway?
Do you know?
No I don't.
I've never driven one.
Actually, I'm thinking about a VW Golf.
I'd like to drive to LA and visit relatives.
Tercels are the most efficient car on the market.
My aunt and uncle have a Tercel, and they hate it.
Really?
Why?
They said it doesn't drive very smoothly.
They're thinking of selling it and buying a Golf.
No kidding?
As I said, I've never driven a Tercel.
No, you might be right.
I'll test drive a Tercel and see how it feels.
Guess what?
I'm going to LA next week.
How are you getting there, by car or by plane?
That's a tough choice.
What do you think?
If I were you, I'd fly.
You can always rent a car in LA.
Actually, I was thinking of driving.
It would be cheaper.
You have a point.
But it takes a lot longer to drive.
It's not that much cheaper when you figure how much gas costs these days.
I know.
Gas is really expensive.
And I heard it's going to get even more expensive.
Still, I would save money driving instead of flying.
You're probably right.
Do you have a place to stay down there?
I'm staying in my aunt and uncle's guest room.
Which freeway are you going to take?
I'm considering taking the coast route, Highway 101.
What do you think?
Highway 5 is a lot faster.
You save about two hours.
True.
But 101 is much more scenic.
There's a nice restaurant just off Highway 5.
It's called Harris Ranch.
I plan to drive the coast route and enjoy the scenery.
What's your plan?
Are you going to drive your new Golf down there?
Yes and I'm very excited.
I've never driven to LA before.
Are you driving to LA by yourself?
Yes.
I asked Sally to go with me, but she's too busy.
Be very careful.
Don't fall asleep at the wheel.
No.
If I feel sleepy, I'll pull off the road and take a nap.
If you get lost, you can look at your map.
I always take a map with me because sometimes I like to go on side trips.
Oh?
What side trip are you going on this time?
I want to drive around Santa Barbara a little.
I've never been to Santa Barbara.
The coast is nice and Santa Barbara is beautiful.
I might grab a meal in Santa Barbara before I go to LA.
Do you think I can get to LA on one tank of gas?
I doubt it.
I'm sure you'll have to stop at a gas station.
That's OK.
I'll have to stop anyway to eat dinner.
Where are you thinking of eating dinner?
Burger King or MacDonalds?
I refuse to stop at any of those fast food restaurants.
I want a nice meal if I'm going to drive for seven hours.
Good luck finding a decent restaurant off Highway 101.
How was your weekend in LA?
Did you enjoy driving down there?
I took your suggestion and drove Highway 5.
It was pretty fast.
Did you stop at the Harris Ranch?
Yes, I had a real nice dinner there.
You weren't disappointed by the scenery?
I didn't care for the scenery much, but I brought some good music so I was entertained.
I drove back to San Francisco by the coast route.
It must have taken much longer.
Yes, it took a lot longer.
But the scenery was very nice, especially the ocean.
Did you stop in Santa Barbara as you had planned?
Yes I did.
I drove around Santa Barbara and had a bite to eat there.
I'm glad you enjoyed your trip in spite of everything.
I was supposed to go to the dentist, but I forgot.
Did you miss your dental appointment?
It completely slipped my mind.
I've had my yearly physical, but I haven't had my dental exam yet.
You'd better call the dentist office now and make another appointment.
I've been brushing my teeth regularly and using floss.
I wouldn't worry about your teeth if I were you.
Something came up.
I can't go to the movies with you.
Oh, that's all right.
We can do it another time.
My boss told me I have to work a double shift today.
We can take a rain check.
No problem.
Next weekend, if you aren't doing anything, we can go.
I think I'll be free next weekend.
I'll give you a call.
I went to see it.
I wanted to see it too, but I was busy.
How was it?
You didn't miss much.
The story wasn't very interesting.
I went to the museum.
The paintings were exciting.
I want to go there.
I haven't seen their current exhibit.
I think you'd enjoy it a lot.
If you take a keyboarding class, you'll learn to type 25 words per minute.
When do they offer keyboarding?
In the morning, from 8 to 12.
She is the teacher.
I'm really interested in learning about computers.
This class is a very good introduction.
I know how to type, but I type very slowly.
Have you taken the books back to the library yet?
Not yet.
I plan to drop them off this afternoon.
They should have been taken back yesterday.
You're right.
They were due yesterday, weren't they?
That's all right.
The fine is only ten cents a book.
I borrowed eight books.
I'll have to pay 80 cents.
Last week, somebody parked in front of my driveway.
What did you do?
Did you call the police?
Yes.
I had to call them.
I didn't have any other choice.
Did you give them the license number?
Yes I did.
The police came about an hour later.
The car was towed away.
There aren't enough parking spaces in this city.
There will be a neighborhood meeting tonight.
Oh good.
I'll be there.
What are we discussing?
We're discussing some neighborhood problems
There have been quite a few problems lately.
Yes, there have.
There's been a lot of noise from construction.
Yes, and sometimes it lasts until late at night.
There are other problems in our neighborhood.
People drive too fast.
It's dangerous for children.
That's right.
They should put up more stop signs.
Last week I saw an accident that could have been avoided.
It wouldn't have happened if there had been a stop sign.
If the neighbors speak up, we can make some changes.
Did you go to the meeting last night?
Yes I did.
Most of the neighbors attended it.
I'm sorry I couldn't go to it.
I had to work late.
It was the best meeting we've had so far.
What problems did the neighbors discuss?
We discussed crime, parking, drugs, and noise.
We didn't decide on a location for the next meeting.
You can hold the next meeting at my house.
That's very generous of you.
We'll probably accept your offer.
How many do you think might show up to the meeting?
I would guess around twenty five people.
Is that too many?
No it's not.
Since I wasn't able to come last night, I want to contribute something.
It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, and it wasn't the worst.
I've seen better movies.
The characters weren't especially interesting.
The best thing about the movie was the coke and the popcorn.
I didn't especially like the popcorn.
It had too much butter on it.
The special effects were exciting.
I really believed those people were in space.
I thought the story was unbelievable.
Could you tell me how to get to the movie theater from here?
I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm new here.
I don't know my way around the city.
Thank you anyway.
Why don't you ask that young man over there?
He looks like he's been living here a while.
Which young man are you talking about?
That one with the red cap.
I'm sure he'll be able to help you.
Can you tell me where the movie is showing?
I believe it's showing at the Metro Cinema.
Do you happen to know when it starts?
I don't know when it starts.
But you can find out by looking in the Chronicle.
Here it is.
It's in the Datebook Section.
This is yesterday's paper.
You can check today's schedule by calling this number.
How did you like the movie?
Well to tell the truth 
I was a little disappointed.
Disappointed?
Why?
It got great reviews, didn't it?
It wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be.
Really?
All my friends told me it was the most exciting movie they've ever seen.
I really expected it to be a lot more interesting.
I prefer the 
I saw it.
I wasn't as thrilled by it as you seem to be.
Really?
Don't you think the special effects were awesome?
Actually, I thought the whole thing was rather ridiculous.
It was supposed to be funny.
After all, it was a satire.
I hoped it would be more entertaining.
I think there's too much violence on children's cartoon programs.
I'm not sure I agree with you.
You're not?
Don't you think all that violence is harmful for children to see?
Not really.
I don't think most children are affected by it.
I don't agree with you at all.
It seems to me that children know that cartoon violence isn't real.
I think there's too much sentimentality in afternoon soap operas.
I completely disagree with you.
In my opinion, those shows are wonderful.
How can you say that?
There's nothing worse than those tear jerkers.
I believe the characters are completely realistic.
Realistic?
No they're not.
They're totally phony.
It sounds to me like we have a difference of opinion.
What would you like to do after dinner?
I wouldn't mind going to a movie.
That's not a bad idea.
We haven't been to a movie in a long while.
Let's check the paper to see if there's anything interesting playing.
There's an Elizabeth Taylor movie playing at the Castro.
We've already seen it, remember?
It was on Channel 9 last week.
It's raining and the children are bored.
Let's take them to the movies.
Are there any children's movies playing today?
As a matter of fact there is.
The Disney movie
Beauty and The Beast is playing at the Castro.
Is there a matinee showing?
Yes, there is.
It starts at 3 pm.
Let's go.
We'll have to hurry.
We have only a half hour.
And we have to find a parking place.
How long have you been living in San Francisco?
For only six months.
I like it.
It's a nice city.
It's a lot colder and wetter than your country, isn't it?
I don't mind living in a colder climate.
There's a lot of traffic on the freeways and streets.
Yes, but, if you avoid driving downtown, the traffic doesn't bother you.
Were any relatives of yours living here when you arrived?
My brother had been living here for about six years.
Was he able to show you around a little?
He helped me a lot because I had never shopped in an American supermarket before.
Had you ever eaten American food before coming here?
No I hadn't.
Since coming here, I've had a couple of hamburgers, but they're nothing to write home about.
What are you planning do over the next six months?
Of course, I would like to learn more English.
Do you plan to take some courses at City College?
Now that I'm settled and have an afternoon job, I'd like to take some courses in the morning.
Houses are very expensive here.
Are you thinking of buying a house eventually?
That's way in the future.
I have to be able to make a living first.
Where were you living before you came to the US?
I lived in El Salvador for most of my life.
What do you remember most about El Salvador?
I remember the beautiful beaches, the green tropical trees, and the delicious food.
Do you have any plans to visit your country soon?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I'm thinking of going there in August, before Fall Semester.
How did you spend your first day in San Francisco?
We got in my brother's car and took a tour of the city.
Did you see Golden Gate Park and Civic Center?
Yes we did.
Then we went for a drive over the bridge and visited Sausalito.
Did you have any trouble finding your way around?
Not really.
My brother is very familiar with the Bay Area, and he showed me everything.
Do you miss your family in Mexico?
Yes I do.
I haven't seen them in about two years.
Do you talk with them on the phone?
Yes.
I've been calling them about once a week since I got here.
What kind of work does your father do?
He drives a tractor.
He's been driving tractors since he was 25 years old.
Tell me about your life in San Francisco.
I like my current job better than the one I had before.
What kind of job did you have when you first came to this country?
I worked as a cook's helper.
I had to get up at 4 am every day.
Since you left that job, what have you been doing?
I've been working as a mechanic for a good service station.
What impressed you your first day here?
I was amazed to see the large buildings.
I had never seen such large buildings before.
Yes, the buildings are large.
Especially downtown.
I was frightened of the freeway.
I had never seen a freeway before.
That's right.
The cars go very fast on it.
I was confused to see people without homes.
I had never seen so many homeless people before.
What country is Sylvia from?
Nicaragua.
She's been here for one year.
Does she have a job or is she looking?
She has a job as a housekeeper.
She's had that job for about four months.
What does she do when she finishes work?
She eats dinner quickly then goes to school.
She's on a very tight schedule.
What does Sylvia want to do?
She's interested in getting a better job, but she needs to learn more English.
What kind of work is she interested in?
She's tired of being a housekeeper.
She would like to be a secretary.
She'll need to take word processing.
Mission Campus has a good clerical training program.
Yes.
She hopes to enroll in a computer class.
Maria has had a difficult time since she moved here.
Why has her life been so difficult?
She has three children.
She brought them with her when she came here.
What about her husband?
Did he come too?
Maria is a widow.
She has been raising the children herself.
That's hard.
She has had to support herself and her three children, and take care of them.
I don't know how we were able to manage, but everything turned out OK.
You must have worked very hard to support your children.
Yes I did.
But that's water under the bridge
Are your children all grown up now?
Yes they are.
Two of them are married with children of their own.
That's wonderful.
How long have you been a grandmother?
Six years.
My oldest grandchild is six.
It's difficult to move to another country.
What in your opinion, is the most difficult thing?
What is the most difficult thing?
By far, the hardest thing is the language.
You're right.
I feel the same way.
It's a real stumbling block.
If you don't speak English, people sometimes take advantage of you.
After I studied English a while, things got much better for me.
My first job wasn't bad.
It could've been a lot worse.
I was a baby sitter.
Did you work full time or part time?
I was a full time baby sitter.
I had a lot responsibilities.
Tell me about your employer.
Was she nice?
She was very nice.
She helped me a lot.
She gave me a lot of advice.
I'm glad your first job was a good experience.
I have a good friend at the restaurant.
He's been very supportive.
It helps to have a good friend at work.
He explains how to make special foods.
How long have you known him?
I've known him for three years.
We like to talk.
I ate at your restaurant last week.
It was great.
I try to put my paycheck in my savings account.
That's a good idea.
If you can save money, you have more options.
I always have a lot of bills to pay, and it isn't always possible to save.
I try to save at least ten percent of my paycheck every month.
I've only been in this country for one year.
After you work for a while, you'll be able to save to save more.
Has it been a long time since you left Nicaragua?
I haven't been in this country too long.
Only a couple of years.
Tell me how you felt when you started living here.
I was sad for the first three months because I had never been away from my country before.
But you probably adjusted to your new country quickly.
Yes, but I've always missed my family and friends.
How do you like San Francisco?
I'm beginning to enjoy being here.
It's a nice place.
Really?
Don't you think it's gets too cold in winter?
I don't complain about the weather as much as I used to.
What about public transportation?
The bus system isn't bad.
It's convenient sometimes.
And sometimes it's not.
Why did you come to The United States?
I came here in order to get a good education.
What classes are you taking at Mission Campus?
I'm in the G.E.D.
program and I've almost completed it.
I'll be taking the test next Friday.
I'm also interested in the G.E.D.
program.
I haven't enrolled in it yet, but I want to.
They prepare you for the examination.
If you pass it, you receive a high school diploma.
What would you like to do when you finish G.E.D.?
I want enroll in City College for two years and get an AA degree.
Will you be continuing your education beyond the AA?
Yes.
I'm hoping to attend UC Berkeley for my Junior and Senior years.
Will you eventually return to your country or will you make this your home?
That depends on a lot of factors.
I really haven't decided yet.
If you visit Yellow Mountain, you won't be interested in visiting another mountain.
In China, that's what you often hear people say.
It is the most beautiful mountain in China.
My husband and I went there when we retired.
Why are the pine trees called “iron pines?”
The roots grow deeply into the rocks.
Therefore, 
The trees can withstand strong winds.
What was the hardest part of your journey?
Climbing 700 stairs to reach the top.
When we got there, I felt ecstatic.
Why is it called this name?
Because the Chinese thought their country was the only one that had four seasons.
That's right.
They thought that the East was the season of spring only.
And the West was the season of autumn.
The North was winter, and the South was summer.
Only China had all four.
So, China must be in the middle.
My home town is the capital of Iran which is Tehran.
Iran is a country very rich in natural resources, yet many of its people are poor.
Why is that?
In its history, Iran has been attacked by its neighbors many times.
Also, Iran has suffered under several dictatorships.
The most recent dictator was the Shah.
Unfortunately, he was supported by the U.S. and by oil companies.
You can understand why Iranians were angry at the U.S. and the C.I.A.
During the Cultural Revolution, I was forced to labor in the countryside.
That was very difficult for you.
You had two sons, aged four and two years old.
I was allowed to visit them only once a month.
Of course, I was worried about them.
After that, you moved to Hong Kong.
You waited three and a half years for a visa from the U.S.
Yes.
Living in the U.S. wasn't easy at first.
My husband didn't get as good a job as he wanted.
Now your two sons are grown up.
They're both computer scientists, and they're doing very well.
Even though I am getting older, my life is much happier now.
When I became a grandmother, it was the best day of my life.
Your grandson was the biggest baby in the nursery.
While he was growing up, he did something new every day that amazed us.
He is very amazing.
At three years old, he is very intelligent, and he speaks clearly.
When I take him to the park to play, I feel like a young girl again.
He's a big, handsome boy with lots of charisma.
Chinese people aren't used to eating hamburgers.
They don't like to freeze meat, do they?
They don't think frozen meat can be cooked into delicious food.
Besides, they can go to the market and buy fresh meat all the time.
Have you heard about her new job?
No, I haven't.
Tell me about it.
To make a long story short, her Aunt got it for her.
I hope she can keep this one.
She lost the last one because she was too nervous.
She'll do much better this time around, I'm positive.
Maybe this time she'll be able to keep cool.
I heard she has broken off her engagement to him.
No kidding?
That's a surprise.
I thought those two were inseparable.
She found out through the grapevine he kissed another woman at a party.
And when she confronted him, did he admit it?
He beat around the bush for a while, then he lied about it.
He shouldn't have told a lie to her.
He really pushed her buttons.
She flew off the handle and screamed at him.
I'm glad she gave him a piece of her mind.
So is it a done deal?
Are they finished with each other?
Not completely.
They agreed to remain friends.
But their marriage plans are down the drain.
That's not a problem for her.
She's a real sharp cookie.
She'll find another boyfriend.
Guess what?
Hh has already found another girlfriend.
He has?
Boy, he doesn't waste any time.
Did you pass your final exams?
Yes, just barely.
I was sure I'd failed at least two of them.
You stayed up too late studying.
You shouldn't burn the candle at both ends.
Unfortunately, I didn't stay up late studying.
I was
hanging out at a party.
At a party?
The night before finals?
Not too wise.
Yes, If I had failed, I would have deserved it.
Have you ever seen a house as clean as this one?
No, I haven't.
Everything is as neat as a pin.
Sonia doesn't cut any corners when she cleans.
Her husband David is good with his hands.
He fixes things around the house.
Sonia is an excellent cook.
Her meals are delicious.
Sorry, I'm late.
I was at the dentist's.
Have you two been waiting long?
Not really.
Actually, we've been having fun chewing the fat.
I'm getting hungry.
As a matter of fact, I'm starved.
There's a pretty good restaurant around the corner.
We could grab a bite to eat there.
That's sounds fantastic.
I've been running around like a chicken with its head cut off.
I need to take it easy.
Yes, you need to relax or pretty soon you'll burn out.
I have to get up early tomorrow.
I've got to catch the train to there.
Are you going there on business or just for pleasure?
Who goes there for pleasure?
I have to drop in on our branch office.
What's up?
The new manager is something of a flake.
I might have to straighten him out.
What a drag.
I hope everything works out OK.
Have you seen the Wallace's new car?
What a peach!
Yes I have.
It must have cost an arm and a leg.
Well I'd put it this way.
It wasn't exactly dirt cheap.
Does he have that kind of money to spend?
I didn't think he made so much on his job.
Didn't you know?
His wife's father is a millionaire.
Wow.
That's lucky.
He certainly played his cards right.
Why don't you join our poker club?
It's really a lot of fun.
Thanks but I'm not much of a card player.
I prefer outdoor sports.
You don't have to join the club or anything, just drop by and check it out.
I'd like to, but unfortunately, I've got a lot on my plate right now.
My office is swamped with orders.
You don't do anything but work.
You're getting into a rut.
If you not careful, you'll get burned out.
Yes, but if I don't keep my nose to the grindstone, I'm afraid I might blow it.
How was the party last night?
All told, it was a lot of fun.
But in the beginning, it was pretty boring.
A lot of parties are like that.
They need someone to break the ice.
I'm not good at meeting people.
I'm something of a wallflower.
So who started the ball rolling?
You guessed right.
She went out of her way to see that everyone enjoyed themselves.
He is quite unhappy with his job these days.
Why?
Isn't his new manager cutting it?
No.
And not only that, the new manager is less than honest.
That's sounds like big trouble.
Jeff should go over the manager's head to the top brass and get the guy fired.
It's not as easy as it sounds.
The manager's uncle is on the board of directors.
Sounds like he has a lot on his mind these days.
Keep me posted.
Meanwhile, 
I'll see if I can pull some strings.
I heard that they're flying in somebody from the East Coast just for an interview.
That's off the wall.
There are plenty of people in the Bay Area they could hire.
I don't know why they're going out of their way like this.
Maybe they think this guy from back east is some kind of hotshot.
Hotshot or not.
It's bad policy to overlook your local talent pool.
What really gets to me is the arrogance of the management.
Yes I agree.
Well if you ask me 
They aren't going to get away with it.
What are you going to do about it?
You're only an assistant manager.
You don't have much clout.
Maybe I don't.
But I'm determined.
I'll stop it nothing until I get that promotion.
Don't let this thing get you down.
There's not much point in obsessing about it.
You're in danger of biting off more than you can chew.
My son is in a bad mood these days.
He's a teenager, isn't he?
Teenagers tend to be moody and over the top.
My son will argue at the drop of a hat.
He's becoming a lose cannon.
Perhaps you need to sit down and have a nice, calm one on one chat with him.
If I can ever get him to sit down for a minute.
He's always off doing something.
It's not easy to control teenagers.
Once they've made up their minds, there's no stopping them.
My factory is closing its doors.
I'm moving to Seattle.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll really miss you.
We'll have to keep in touch by email.
Definitely.
Now as soon as you get there, give me a buzz and let me know your new phone and address.
Right.
When we're settled in I'll write and tell you everything that's happening with us.
All right.
Now remember.
You're one of my best friends.
I don't want to lose touch with you.
I can't believe it.
I did all that work for nothing.
The management won't give my report the time of day.
You shouldn't be discouraged.
After all, 
No one can say you didn't hold up your end.
I suppose I shouldn't have been so honest, but I wanted to be straight with them.
It could be they didn't llke what they were hearing in that report.
I tried to spell out as clearly as I could the advantage of hiring local talent.
Maybe they have their heart set on this hotshot from back east.
We're a little up in the air right now.
We don't know where we're going to live.
I have it on good authority that the rents are cheaper in Seattle.
That's what I heard to.
I don't think we're going to end up on the street or anything.
Any time you make a move this big you feel in over your head.
You said it.
I'll be very glad when we've nailed things down.
Who let the cat out of the bag?
Now Patricia knows about the suprise party.
There's no need to get hot under the collar.
No?
But Patricia won't be surprised at all.
I think we can still have a fine party.
Knowing the truth about the party is the least of her worries.
I guess you're right.
She's going to have a baby in two months.
It's their first.
They're both very excited.
Do you want to go dancing tonight or see a movie?
It's all the same to me.
I would be happy doing either.
I know that I'm asking you out on the spur of the moment, and you haven't thought it over.
I don't know.
It's six of one and half a dozen of the other.
Whatever you decide is OK with me.
Since the movie isn't supposed to be all that hot, maybe we should go dancing.
I'd rather go to the movie and take our chances.
Isn't it wonderful about her?
She's pregnant.
I hope it's good news.
I hope they can handle the added responsibility.
Are you all right?
You sound nervous.
I'm tearing my hair out, I'm so worried about them.
But you're going to be a grandmother.
You ought to be tickled pink about that.
As a matter of fact, I am.
But I'm still losing sleep over this turn of events.
Just because she is on the nest, she isn't going to lose her job.
Her friends are throwing a surprise baby shower for her.
She already knows.
Some loony let the cat out of the bag.
Jose really feels left out.
His friends should take him for a night on the town.
It just so happens he got a call this afternoon, but he wasn't around to pick up the phone.
They both deserve to celebrate.
After the baby arrives, their evenings will be pretty much sewn up.
I don't know about that.
I think the couple plans to use us as baby sitters every once and a while.
Yes, I wouldn't be surprised if they did.
In fact, I'm kind of looking forward to taking care of a little one.
So am I.
It's been a long time since I took care of an infant.
I must admit, I'm a little rusty.
But I warn you.
Having a baby in your house might take a little getting used to.
I wouldn't mind doing it now and then, as long as it's not a steady diet.
I think we'd better jump in the car and head to the hospital.
It's better to be safe than sorry.
Oh my God.
Not now.
I forgot to put gas in the car.
It slipped my mind.
Gas or no gas, we've got to hurry.
There's no time to lose.
We're going to run the risk of being out of gas if we don't stop at the station.
That's easy for you say.
You're not the one who is going through this.
I want to get us to the hospital in one piece, OK?
Have you heard latest news?
She gave birth to a darling little girl.
Oh, how sweet.
How are the mother and father holding up?
They're all at the hospital together.
They're doing just fine.
Jose is grinning ear to ear.
He should be proud of his wife.
She was very brave and strong through it all.
He's very lucky to be married to her.
I think they're going to be great parents.
They're both wet behind the ears when it comes to raising a child, but they'll learn the ropes.
This is the conclusion of the dialogue workout.
Eight hundred conversations is a lot of gab.
That's for sure.
Since I started talking English, no one can shut me up.
Yes.
You used to speak very slowly.
Now you're chattering a mile a minute.
Can't you let me get a word in edgewise?
Hello.

Your apartment is a mess.
I know.
I didn't have time to put things away before you got here.
Look!
Are those all your clothes on the couch?
Yes.
Are they clean?
Actually most of them are dirty.
I haven't done laundry in a while.
I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house.
My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street.
Why don't you go there?
I know I should, but that place isn't very convenient.
You have to wait for a long time.
Yes I know.
I have to do it every week.
Are you ready to go?
No I'm not ready yet.
I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face.
Can you wait for a few minutes?
Please hurry.
I think the restaurant is closing soon.
Where's the closest ATM?
It's not that far.
Do you see that yellow building over there?
The big one or the small one?
The big one.
Yes.
It's right next to it, on the right.
Do you know if there's a convenience store around here?
I don't think there's one around here.
The closest one is on rd street, but that's probably closed now.
I really need to get some things before I leave.
You could go down to second street.
There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day.
Can I take the subway to get there?
Yes, but 
That'll probably take about half an hour.
You should just take a cab.

They have good food there.
What did you have?
I had some cereal, fried eggs and orange juice.
How was it?
The food didn't taste very good, and actually I don't feel very well now.
That's too bad.
Do you want to take a break?
I'm going to go back to the hotel at lunch time to lie down.
OK.
I'm going to the drug store later.
Is there anything I can get for you?
That's OK.
I think if I rest for a little while I'll feel better.
What do you want to do tonight?
I'd like to go see a movie.
I heard Titanic is playing at the movie theater.
I've heard that's a good movie.
What time does it start?
five pm.
It's a long movie.
I think it lasts for about two hours.
Will you come and pick me up?
What time?
I think we should get there early because they might be sold out.
Is five pm OK?
That'll be fine.
I'll meet you at your house at five pm.
Do you want to get something to eat before the movie?
I'm not sure there will be enough time for that.
We can have popcorn and hot dogs at the theater if you want.
I don't like the popcorn they have there.
I think they put too much salt on it.
OK then, I'll pick you up a little earlier and we can go to the Thai restaurant next to the theater.
Is that OK?
Yes, I like that place.
How do you like the food?
It tastes really great.
Did you cook it?
Yes.
I made it this afternoon.
Would you like some more?
OK, just a little though.
I'm really full.
Oh.
Would you like some soup instead?
What kind is it?
Tomato and rice.
Have you had that before?
No.
This is my first time.
How does it taste?
It's good, try it.
What do you think?
Wow.
It is good.
Did you make that also?
Yes.
You're a really good cook.
Thanks, next time I'll make chicken soup for us.
That sounds good.
Did you study cooking in school?
No, I learned by myself.
I have a good cook book that I read when I have time.
will you help me take these things to the car?
OK, which car do you want me to put them in?
Bring them to my wife's car.
Which one is hers?
The blue SUV in front of the Honda.
What should I take first?
That chair over there.
Please be careful with it.
It was a gift from my mother-in-law.
Don't worry, I won't drop it.
Wow!
It's really heavy.
I don't think I can move it by myself.
Let me help you with that.
I don't want you to hurt your back.
Where are you taking all this stuff?
Didn't I tell you?
We're moving to Florida?
You're moving now?
I knew you were moving, but 
I thought you said you were moving next month.
Yes that's true, but 
My wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away.
your husband has a really nice car.
Thanks.
It's a lot better than mine, and it's new.
Where are you going?
We're going to visit my sister in the city.
I didn't know your sister lives in the city?
When did she move there?
About a year ago.
She lives in an apartment on rd street, across from the public library.
I see.
It's almost six pm now.
Don't you think there will be a lot of traffic?
We're not driving.
We're going to take the subway.
The subway only takes about thirty minutes.
Yes, but 
It can be very crowded around this time.
I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.
I take the subway to work everyday, so 
I'm used to it now.
Doesn't your mother live in the city?
She has lived there for about ten years.
I remember when she moved there.
Apartments were a lot cheaper then.
I know what you mean.
It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now.
Have a good time.
Next time you're free, give me a call and we'll go play poker.
See you later.
I heard you took a trip to San Diego.
Is that right?
I just got back this morning.
That sounds really nice.
What did you do there?
We were only there for three days, so 
We didn't do too much.
We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times.
At night we walked around the city with some friends.
Did you take any pictures?
I have them with me.
Do you want to look at them?
I love looking at photos.
This one is of my wife and me on the beach
This one is our daughter standing next to my wife.
Your daughter looks like her mother.
I know, they look very similar.
Where was this picture taken?
That was taken at the train station before we left.
Did you have time to go to the zoo?
No, not this time.
We went there last time.
It looks like you all had a nice time.
It was a lot of fun.
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?
I'd like to order some flowers.
Who are they for?
They're for my Wife.
Her name is.
What kind of flowers would you like?
I don't know.
I don't know too much about flowers.
Can you recommend something?
OK.
What's the reason you are sending her flowers?
Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers.
Do you know what kind of flowers she likes?
I'm not sure.
I know I should know that, but 
I can't remember right now.
Well, they're for your wife, so 
I think you should give her roses.
Roses will be fine.
What color?
I think red would be nice.
Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them?
Can you deliver them please.
What's the address?
Main street.
Hello?
Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.
Is this?
Yes.
Who are you looking for again?
Oh, I thought you said 
Sorry about that.
This is the right number, but 
She's not here right now.
Do you know where she went?
She went to the store to buy some groceries.
Would you like to leave a message?
Would you please tell her called?
this is her roommate.
I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party.
Oh yes.
How are you?
Good.
She will be back in about twenty minutes.
I'll tell her you called.
OK.
Thanks.
Bye bye.

I wish it were summer.
Me too.

I'd like to, but 
I'm not sure if I can.
Work has been really busy lately.
Why don't we go on Friday instead?
Friday's not good.

I'm still a student.
What school do you go to?
Boston University.
That's a good school.
What do you study?
I'm studying English, math, and history.
My major is English.
How long have you been studying English?
More than six years.
That's a long time.
I started to learn English when I was in high school.
No wonder your English is so good.
Actually, it's not that good.
I can read but I can't speak very well.
I haven't had a lot of chance to practice.
I see.
Talking with other people is very important.
Yes, but 
I still don't have many friends here yet.
I'm having a party tonight at my apartment.
You should come.
Oh thanks for inviting me.
I'd love to come.
Hey it's good to see you again.
How have you been?
I didn't sleep much last night though.
I stayed up until AM studying for an exam.
I was up late last night too.
The semester is almost over.
I've had exams all week.
Are you going back to California after you graduate?
I think so.
After I graduate I'll probably go back home and try to get a job.
Do you know where you'd like to work?
Not yet, but 
I want to be an English translator.
That'd be really cool.
I'd like to be a translator too, but 
I don't think my English is good enough.
Don't worry about that.
Your English is better than most of my classmates.
Thanks.
Where are you going now?
I'm going to study at the library.
I have to take an exam tomorrow.
Me too.
How late does the library stay open?
I think it's open until five pm.
OK, 
Good luck.
You too.
Hello?
How are you?
Good.
I called you yesterday.
Did you get my message?
I was taking a shower when you called.
I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, but 
I think your phone was off.
No problem.
I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week.
You're still coming to the wedding with me, right?
Is that next week?
Yes.
Did you forget?
No, of course not.
I already bought them a present.
That's good.
I want to invite Megan also.
Next time you see her
Can you tell her for me?
Sure.
Does she know your friend?
I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that.
I'm not exactly sure how they know each other.

I'll pick you up first, and then we'll go get her.
I'd like to see the doctor, please.

Would you mind waiting a little longer?
No problem.
May I see your insurance card please.
Here you are.

It looks like there's something here for you.
Who's it from?
The American Embassy.
My hands are dirty.
Will you open it for me?
Sure.
What does it say?
It says your passport is ready.
You can pick it up anytime.
Do you think you can drive me there?

I think we should go get it now.
I'm going to wash my hands and then we'll go.
Is that OK?
That's fine.
How are you feeling?
I still have a cold.
Still?
It's been over a week now, hasn't it?

Not much.
Where are you?
I'm in the car driving home.
When you get home will you send me an email with directions to the party tonight?
No problem.
When do you think you'll get home?
I don't know
Maybe in about thiry minutes or so.
There's a lot of traffic.
I have to go out soon.

Drive carefully.
I'll see you tonight.

I'm OK now, but I got into an car accident this morning.

It has all the rules on it.

I could sing that song when I was in middle school.

I was worried about you.
Sorry, I was sick.
I went to bed early.
What's wrong?
I had a cough and my eyes were really dry.
Are you better now?
I'm feeling a lot better.
Much better than yesterday.

Last time I went to the doctor, he did some tests and told me I have allergies.
It gets worse in the spring.
What time did you wake up this morning?
Around eight AM.
Are you going to work today?
No.
I think I'll just stay home and watch TV.
I can work from home today.
Good.
Get some rest and I'll bring over some food later.
Thanks.
It's been a long time.
Where are you working now?
I work at a software company downtown.
I'm an engineer.
That's interesting.
What kind of software do you write?
It's a database for small businesses.
Does your company have a website?
Yes.
What's the website address?
How can I get the software?
You can download it from the website.
It's very popular and it's free.
I'll do that.
I have to go now.
It was really nice seeing you again.
It was nice seeing you too.
Email me next week and we'll get together for coffee.
My computer is broken so I can't send email right now.
Can I call you?
My number is 
What are you listening to?
I'm listening to the radio.
I know that.
Who are they playing?
Guess.
I think that's the Beatles, right?
That's right.
How did you know that?
In my country everyone knows who they are.
They're famous.
Really?
Of course.
My parents saw them at a concert a long time ago.
Did you know that they're from England?
Yes, of course.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
I listen to everything, but my favorite is 
I see.
Who's your favorite singer?
I like her too.
She's got a great voice.
Do you need a taxi?
Yes.
Do you have any luggage?
Just these two suitcases.
I'll put them in the back for you.
Where are you going?
The Comfort Inn.
I think there are two in Boston.
Which one are you going to?
The one downtown.
Is this your first time in Boston?
No.
I've been here many times.
I come here for work all the time.
Do you know how long it'll take?
It shouldn't take long.
Probably about sixty minutes.
It looks like the traffic is really bad.
There might be an accident up ahead.
OK, then 
Stop at the next intersection.
I'm gonna get out there and take the subway.
Are you hungry?
No, why?
We've been driving for a long time.
I think we'd better find some place to eat soon.
I'm OK.
We're late so we'd better not stop.
We've passed that same store three times already.
I think we're lost.
We should ask someone for directions.
We're not lost.
I've never gone this way before.
Do you know where you're going?
This road goes through town.
It's faster than the highway.
OK.
Would you mind driving a little slower please?
Sure.
No problem.
Did you see that sign back there?
I think this is a one way street.
No, I didn't see it.
I'm going to have to turn around.
You can't turn around here.
I think you should let me drive.
I think you're right.
I'm getting tired.
Can you do me a favor?
Sure.
I can't find my purse.
Can you help me?
No problem.
I'll help you look for it.
Thanks.
What color is it?
It's black.
Did you look in the kitchen?
I already looked there.
I'll look in the living room.
Did you find it?
No.
It's not in there.
When was the last time you saw it?
I had it when I went to the library this morning.
Do you think you might have left it there?
Maybe.
I'll call the library and ask them if anyone found it.
Wait!
Is this it?
Yes That's it.
That's it.
That's my purse.
Thanks for helping me find it.
Excuse me, sir
Will you take a picture of us?
Sure.
This is a really nice camera.
My parents gave it to me.
How do you use it?
You press this button here.
Come a little closer.
Wait.
That's too close.
Move a little to the left.
Move back a little farther.
Stay right there.
Do you mean here?
Yes that's good.
I can't get it to work.
You need to hold down the button for about thirty seconds.
OK I got it, are you ready?
Yes.
Smile.
What's going on?
I'm waiting in line to buy a DVD player.
The line is too long.
Why don't you come back tomorrow.
I think you're right.
They're going to close soon.
Let's go get some coffee.
OK.
Wait a minute.
I have to get something out of my purse.
Will you hold this for me?
Sure.
Oops.
What happened?
I dropped your calculator.
Is it broken?
I'm not sure.
Let me have a look.
I don't think it's broken.
The button came off though.
I can fix it.
Sorry about that.
Don't worry about it.
I do that all the time.
If it is broken, 
I have another one in my car.
How did you get here?
I rode my bike.
Are you serious?
Why did you do that?
I could have picked you up.
That's OK.
I didn't want to bother you.
I know you don't like to wake up early.
That's so nice of you.
Aren't you cold?
No, not really.
I wore a coat.
What's in the bag?
It's a special type of apple.
Oh.
Can I try one?
It's very sweet.
I put sugar on it.
These apples are really good.
They were only ten cents each.
Aren't those more expensive than the ones at the supermarket?
They're more expensive, but they taste better.
Did you buy any other fruit?
I bought oranges and bananas.
Hello?
Hi.
Are you still up?
Yes.
You sound tired.
Is everything OK?
Everything's fine.
I'm just getting ready to go to bed.
It's been a really long day.
Do you have time to get some coffee with me later?
I have something I want to talk to you about.
No sorry.
Not today.
I have to get up early tomorrow.
What are you going to do tomorrow?
My mother-in-law is coming over so I have to get up early and clean the house.
I see.
Are you free tomorrow?
Yes, in the afternoon.
I have to finish something I'm working on, but I'll be free after 5.
Do you want to get together after you finish work?
Do you think you'll have time?
My mother-in-law will be leaving here around 4 pm.
I just talked to him.
What did he say?
He said he had to cancel the meeting this afternoon.
Oh, I see.
Is there a problem?
It's not a big deal.
He and I were supposed to talk to some new customers today.
Sorry to hear that.
It's OK.
This has been happening quite a bit recently.
That's strange.
I wonder why?
His wife has been sick, so 
Sometimes he has to go home early to take care of her.
I see.
How's work been going?
Things are slow right now.
Would you mind if I borrow your phone, mine's out of batteries and 
I have to call my boss to tell him about this.
OK Let me go get it.
Its in the car.
Hello?
Sorry for calling so late.
I hope I didn't wake you up.
Actually, I was just finishing some work.
I haven't gone to bed yet.
Did you hear got fired yesterday?
No.
I didn't hear that.
Are you sure?
She told me this afternoon.
She was pretty upset about it.
That's too bad.
He is a nice guy.
I know.
Why did they fire him?
She didn't say.
I see.
If you talk to her again, tell her there's a job opening at my company.
Can have an interview this week if he wants.
Thank you so much.
I'll call her and tell her.
You look upset.
What's wrong?
It's nothing.
I'm just a little nervous.
Is everything all right?
I'm having surgery tomorrow on my finger.
What's wrong with your finger?
I broke it the other day playing basketball.
That's terrible.
It's been bothering me since that day.
Are you afraid of having surgery?
Yes.
I've never had surgery before.
I wouldn't worry.
I had to have surgery on my leg last year.
Everything went fine.
Were you nervous before the surgery?
A little.
Who is your doctor?
I've heard he's really good.
I don't think you have anything to worry about.
Good.
That makes me feel much better.
Are you and him still dating?
Things are going really good.
Where did you meet him?
I met him at the library a couple of weeks ago.
We were sitting at the same table and he asked to borrow my pen.
Wow!
That's a nice story.
I was telling about it the other day.
He thought it was pretty romantic.
Do you two have plans for tonight?
I think we're going to rent a movie.
Have you seen anything good lately?
I saw it the other day.
I've heard that's a really funny movie.
Are you kidding?
That movie's not funny.
It's sad.
I was crying at the end.
You're really sensitive, aren't you?
I guess so.
Maybe that's why I can't find a girlfriend.
Can I talk to you for a moment.
I just heard the cookie factory downtown is going out of business.
Where did you hear that?
told me.
I'm not sure that's true.
I haven't heard anything about it.
She said that they have already started to lay people off.
Doesn't your father work there?
I'm really worried he might get laid off.
He just started to work there about three months ago.
What do you think I should do?
I'd talk to your father.
If there was something wrong I don't think he'd tell me.
He doesn't like to upset me, but 
I really would like to know what's going on.
So what are you gonna do?
Aren't you good friends with the president of that company?
We use to work together at a different company about five years ago.
Maybe you could call him and see what's going on.
Well, I don't know.
I don't know.
I guess I could.
It's pretty late now, but 
I'll call him in the morning.
Thanks so much.
Wow!
I'm really getting fat.
You don't look fat.
Yes, but
I am.
I've gained ten pounds in the last two months.
Look at my stomach.
How much do you weigh?
I think about twenty pounds.
What kind of foods do you eat?
I usually have pasta for dinner.
Sometimes I get takeout or fast food if I don't have enough time to cook.
I was reading a diet book the other day.
It said that if you eat meat and nothing else, you'll lose weight quickly.
Wow!
Does that work?
I don't know, but 
Someone told me they tried it and lost ten pounds.
That sounds good but 
I'm not sure how long I could do that.
I know.
Once you start eating vegetables and bread again you'll probably start gaining weight.
Well I think I'm going to try it anyway.
I think I'm going to try it anyway.
I'm going to try it anyway.
Who's the author?
I can't remember.
It's not that popular anymore.
When I get home I'll check and give you a call.
Hello?
I can't talk now.
Can I call you back later?
Sure.
Is there a problem?
I'm late for work and my car isn't working, so 
I need to find someone to take me to work.
I can take you.
Oh really?
Thank you.
That would help a lot.
Do you need me to pick you up after work also?
Yes, if it's not too much trouble.
It's no problem.
I'm leaving my house now.
I'll be right there.
OK.
I'll wait for you in front of my apartment building.
Do you know what's wrong with your car?
I'm not exactly sure.
I think there's a problem with the engine.
I'll have a look when I get there.
I know a lot about cars.
When I was younger my father and I use to fix old cars.
What have you been doing today?
Nothing, just watching TV.
I'm really bored.
I don't have anything to do.
I don't have anything to do either.
I didn't do anything today except clean my house.
I know.
I was planning to go to the mall today with one of my friends, but 
It snowed so much we couldn't go anywhere.
I hope it snows all night because I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
Do you know anyone who has a camera?
I want to take a picture of all this snow.
I don't know anyone who has a camera.
Have you seen today?
I think she might have one.
She hasn't been around all day.
She said she had something important to do today?
Where did she go?
Nobody knows.
I called her roommate and she doesn't know either.
did you know she called you?
No.
When did she call?
Two hours ago, I think.
Two hours ago?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Sorry, I forgot.
What did she say?
She said she's waiting for you at her sister's place.
I was going to cook dinner first, but 
I don't think I have enough time now.
I'll just warm up some leftovers in the microwave.
OK.
If she calls again tell her I'm gonna to be late.
OK no problem.
This is very important.
Don't forget.
Don't worry.
I won't forget.
Would you please hand me my phone?
I think I should give her a call now.
She's probably wondering where I am.
I'll get it for you.
I'm going shopping.
Do you want to come?
I thought you went shopping yesterday.
I did, but 
An old friend called me last night and invited me to his birthday party.
I need to buy a gift for him.
I see.
What are you going to get him?
I really have no idea what he likes.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
What do you think?
Maybe a cake?
That's a good idea, but 
I think I should probably get him something else, like something he can wear.
How about a sweater?
I saw a really nice one in the mall the other day.
Maybe we can go there and take a look.
What store was it in?
It was at Macy's.
I think they're having a sale this weekend.
That's a really nice store.
I like the clothes there.
What are you doing here?
Hi how are you?
I'm waiting for a friend.
I heard you're going to graduate this summer.
Is that true?
Yes.
If everything goes all right
I'll be getting my bachelors degree in August.
Then I need to start looking for a job.
I had to do that last year.
It wasn't easy.
Do you have any job offers?
No not yet.
I sent out a lot of resumes, but 
I didn't receive many responses.
It's pretty hard to find a job right now.
What's your major?
Psychology.
That was my major when I started college, but 
I switched to engineering after the first year.
I think it's easier for engineers to find a job.
I'm not sure about that.
It took me about six months to find a job.
I finally was able to get a job after I put my resume on one of those job websites.
Anyway it
It really doesn't matter.
If I can't find a job I'll probably go back to school to get my Masters degree.
Hello?
Hey.
What's up?
I haven't talked to you in a long time.
What's been happening?
Well I don't know if you heard, I just moved into a new apartment in LA.
I don't know if you heard.
I just moved into a new apartment in LA.
I heard you were thinking about moving but I didn't know you'd already found a place.
That's cool.
I'm really happy about it.
Do you have any roommates?
No not this time.
It's a big change for me because I've never lived alone.
Don't you think you'll be lonely?
Not really.
I have two friends who live in the same building.
We all had dinner together last night.
Are they students also?
They're not students, but 
There are a lot of students living in the building.
Sounds like a nice place.
I think it's a good environment for learning English.
I'm glad to hear everything worked out.
You should come out here and visit me sometime.
There's even a pool.
That would be nice.
I'll think about it.
Have you found a girlfriend yet?
No not yet.
What about her?
She has a boyfriend.
I thought they broke up.
They're still together.
How about that girl from work you were telling me about last year?
Who?
She's married now.
She got married last month.
I see.
It seems like everyone our age is married.
It's not easy.
Is there anyone you're interested in?
There is one girl I like who lives in my building.
I talk to her a lot because she's also studying English.
What's she like?
She's really nice.
She moved here from Texas about six months ago.
What does she do?
She's an accountant.
That's a good job.
She must be really smart.
Have you asked her out yet?
Actually we're going to dinner on Friday.
Good luck.
Sorry to bother you.
I have a question for you.
OK, what's up?
I've been having a problem with my computer.
I know you're an engineer so I thought you might be able to help me.
I see.
What's the problem?
I have a file that I can't open for some reason.
What type of file is it?
It's a Word document I've been working on.
I need to finish it by tomorrow.
Were you able to open it before, on the computer you're using now?
I was working on it last night and everything was fine, but 
This morning I couldn't open the file.
Do you think your computer might have a virus?
I checked and there weren't any.
OK.
I'm not sure what's wrong.
If it's possible, email the file to me and 
I'll see if I can get it to open.
I'll do that when I get home.
Are you going to be around tonight?
I'll be home after 5 pm.
Send it to me when you get a chance and I'll call you later.
Do you know how to get downtown?
Sure.
Why are you going there?
I want to buy a new computer.
Are you driving?
Yes.
Go straight down this road.
When you get to the second light, take a left.
Then get on the highway and take exit 
That sounds really complicated.
Can you tell me again?
Which road do I take first?
You go down this road, then at the second light turn left.
That road is Main street.
I think I've got it now.
Why are you buying a new computer anyway?
Didn't you just get one a few months ago?
Yes but it doesn't work anymore.
Where did you buy it?
At Wal-Mart.
I think you're computer should still be under warranty.
You can bring it back to them and they'll fix it for free.
I think you're right.
I didn't think about that.
I should go talk to them about it.
Where is the closest Wal-Mart?
It's about three blocks from here.
I have to go there to get some stuff now anyway.
Do you want to follow me?
Sure.
Did you see the news today?
No, what happened?
There was a big earthquake in San Diego.
Oh my goodness.
The president was on the news talking about it earlier.
Was anyone hurt?
I think they said two people were killed.
That's terrible.
I can't believe you hadn't heard about it.
They were talking about it on CNN all day.
I don't watch TV that often.
Don't you watch the news?
I usually read the news online, but 
I haven't had time to turn on my computer today.
What's your favorite sport?
I like basketball.
I watch the games on TV all the time.
Who's your favorite team?
The Boston Celtics.
They're really good this year, aren't they?
Yes.
Do you like them?
Yes.
Everyone around here does.
Do you think they'll win the championship this year?
It's possible.
They have some really good players.
Did you watch the game last night?
A little, not the whole thing.
I watched the second half though and I saw some of the highlights online.
It was a great game, wasn't it?
Do you know who they're playing tomorrow night?
I think their playing LA.
That's going to be a tough game.
they have a good team.
Are you working on your webpage now?
I'm still waiting for you to send me that image file for the homepage.
You mean you didn't get it?
I sent it to you over an hour ago.
Let me check.
It's going to take a second because I have to start up my computer.
OK.
Did you get it?
One second.
I just have to open my web browser and check my hotmail account.
OK.
Here it is.
I got it.
How do I find the webpage?
I tried to search for it on Yahoo but I couldn't find it.
Don't use Yahoo, use Google.
I tried that also and it didn't work.
If you go to Google and search for my name, you should be able to find it.
OK.
Let me try that.
I see it now.
I'm tired.
Would you mind driving for a while?
Sorry.
I would like to, but 
I don't know how to drive.
Really?
You don't have a license?
I thought everyone had a license.
I've lived in cities all my life and when I'm at home I usually take the subway or bus.
I see.
Do you think you'll learn to drive in the future?
Yes.
I plan to buy a car next year.
I think you need one in the U.S.
Actually, now that I think about it, a lot of people in cities here take the bus also.
A lot of people in cities here take the bus also.
I'd like to travel more.
I've been here for a few months already and I feel like I haven't seen anything yet.
How are you going to learn to drive?
Do you want me to teach you?
I wouldn't want to trouble you.
I've already signed up for a class near my house.
It starts next month.
Your English is so good.
How did you learn it?
In my country everyone has to take English starting in the first grade.
I've been taking English courses for ten years now.
Wow!
That's interesting.
I remember when we took that trip last year and visited your family.
It seemed like there weren't many people that could speak with me in English.
That's because they don't speak English that much.
But they speak it in school, right?
Maybe they just didn't like me so they didn't want to talk to me.
No, actually they liked you a lot.
They liked you a lot.
They told me they thought you were very nice.
They are just shy.
They're not use to talking with foreigners.
I remember when I first came to the U.S.
I was really nervous about speaking with people.
I see.
I thought there were lots of Americans teaching English in your country.
Yes that's true.
There are probably twice as many now as there were five years ago, but they are mostly in the cities.
My family lives in the country.
I wonder why.
Personally I prefer the country to the city.
It's so quiet and peaceful.
If I were to teach, I would want to teach in the country.
Do you think you would want to teach someday?
I know the schools around my town are looking for teachers, so if you want I can call them and get more information.
No, I don't think so.
I would need to stay there for a year, and I don't think I can take that much time off work.
Well if you change your mind, let me know.
I think you would be a really great teacher.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Oh yes, it's almost Christmas, isn't it.
I'm not sure what I'll be doing then.
Well if you don't have any plans, you family could have dinner at my house.
That's very nice of you, thanks.
Have you finished your shopping yet?
No, I still have to do that.
I think I'll go to the mall this weekend.
It's going to be really crowded at the mall.
You should shop online.
You're right.
My family loves to read, so I can probably get them all presents from Amazon.com.
What do you think you'll get for your wife?
Probably a romance novel.
It seems like she's always reading one of those.
Don't you think you should get her something a little more expensive, like jewelry or maybe a new computer?
Maybe you're right.
It's hard buying gifts.
I think my wife has everything she wants.
Maybe I should just ask her.
Who are you going to vote for?
Yes.
I'm not sure yet.
You should make up your mind soon.
The election is next month.
Yes, I know.
I hear about it every day on the news.
I'm going to vote for him.
I think he is a good choice, but I think she would make a good president also.
I know.
They're both good.
It's hard to decide.
He is older but he has more experience.
It's hard to know what the truth is.
That's the reason I really don't pay attention to politics.
Yes, it can be frustrating, but it's important and it's interesting to watch.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure, what's up?
I wanted to let you know about a book club I joined a couple months ago.
I know you do a lot of reading so I thought you might want to come with me next month.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
When does the group meet?
Usually the last Saturday of the month at : in the evening.
Is that too late for you?
No, I think that's OK.
What do you talk about in the group?
Every month we choose a new book and then during the next meeting we discuss it.
What book are you reading now?
The Kite Runner.
I've heard that's a good book.
What's it about?
It is a good book.
I'm almost finished.
The book is about a boy who grows up in Afghanistan.
It's called the Kite Runner because the main character takes part in a kite flying competition.
That sounds really interesting.
I'd love to come.
Ok, great.
The next meeting isn't for another two weeks, so you still have time to read the book.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Ever so sorry.
How stupid of me.
Pardon me
That's my fault.
Sorry.
It was all my fault.
Please excuse my ignorance
Please don't be mad at me.
Please accept our sincerest apologies.

I'd like to know.
D'you know.
Have you any idea?
Could anyone tell me?
Do you happen to know?
Would you happen to know?
I don't suppose you would know?
I wonder if you could tell me?

I'm quite partial to spicy things.
I'm really into it in a big way.
You can't beat a good Indian meal.
Give me Thai food any day.
I'm particularly fond of hot curries.
There's nothing I like more than.
Thai food is what I live for.
What I wouldn't give for a Thai curry!

That's exorbitant
It cost a fortune.
That's daylight robbery.
They must have seen you coming
It's a doddle.
Easy peasy.
It's a cinch.

My guess is that she'll lose
There's just a chance that it will work
I wouldn't be surprised if it rained

On second thoughts.
Come to think of it.
I've had a change of heart.
Hang on a minute

I think.
That's not how I see it.
What a pity
What a shame!
How disappointing!
That's too bad.
What a bummer!
That's just so disappointing!
I was so looking forward to.
We had high hopes for.
It did not live up to expectation.
What we had been led to expect was.
I don't think much of that.
How apalling
How dreadful!
I'm utterly apalled
I'm utterly disgusted.
I'm dead against people doing.
It shouldn't be allowed!
What a rotten thing to do
What a mean thing to do
I take a very dim view of people doing.
Who do they think they are?
How can people do things like that?
Whatever next?

The way I see it.
As far as I'm concerned.
If you don't mind me saying.
I'm utterly convinced that.
In my humble opinion.
In my opinion, this one would be better.
To my mind this one's better.
If you ask me, this one's better.
To my way of thinking, this one's fine.
In my view, this one is best.
Know what I think?
That one's best.
I'd say that one's better.
What I think is that one's better.
For me, that one's better.
I tell you what I think, that one's best.
I always make a point of 
Whenever I get the chance, I 
I have a habit of 
I can't seem to stop 
I'm always 
I can't help.
I don't expect they'll win.
It's quite unlikely they'll win.
They are not very likely to win.
I shouldn't think they'll win.
There's not much hope.
There's not much chance.
I'd be very surprised if they won.
I wouldn't bet on them winning.
There's no chance of them winning.
There's little likelihood of them winning.
It'll never happen in a month of Sundays.
It's going to happen quite soon.
It's going to happen very soon.
In just a moment.
In just a minute.
In just a few minutes.
Any second now,
Any minute now,
Any day now,
Not long now.
In the near future.
Before long,
Is just around the corner
will happen in our lifetimes

I'm a big fan of Indian food.
I'm absolutely crazy about it.
I'm quite partial to spicy things.
I'm really into it in a big way.
You can't beat a good Indian meal.
Give me Thai food any day.
I'm particularly fond of hot curries.
There's nothing I like more than.
Thai food is what I live for.
What I wouldn't give for a Thai curry!
You must be Susan's husband.
How's your wife?
How is your friend?
Nice weather, isn't it?
What's new?
I haven't seen you for ages.
What have you been up to?
Are you still working for the same firm?
Have you heard from Jenny recently?
What a coincidence!
Fancy meeting you here!
Why don't we go to the cinema?
Let's go to the cinema.
What do you think?
How about going to the cinema?
How do you feel about seeing a film?
Fancy seeing a film?
I'd like to see a film.
How about you?
We could always see a film.
Why not go and see a film?
Seeing a film's one idea.
It would be nice to see a film.
Joy-riding

Happy slapping
Just next door to my home
Just beside
On my street
On the same street as.
Just up the road
Just down the road
Not far from my home
Right on my doorstep
Just a stone's throw away
Just round the corner
A two-minute walk from
In your neck of the woods
A deafening roar
A high-pitched scream
A terrible din
A piercing shriek
A fading echo
A muffled reply
A booming voice
A creaking door
A low murmur
A bloody racket
I couldn't say.
I've never given it much thought.
I don't have any feelings either way.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I really don't know what to say.
I really can't say.
You're asking the wrong person.
It doesn't affect me either way.
It doesn't make any difference to me.
That's an interesting question.
He got somebody's back up.
She caused offense
He caused outrage
I put somebody's nose out of joint
I got on the wrong side of sombody
She reduced somebody to tears
They put him down
She showed me up in front of others
We got in her black books
He dissed my new hairstyle
She took umbrage at my remarks
Basically,
In a nutshell,
To paraphrase,
To put it another way,
What it all boils down to is.
To sum up then.
In other words,
What this means is that.
Put it this way.
Look at it this way.
She's the life and soul of the party.
She's a great mixer.
She gets on with everyone.
She's a live wire.
She's a real party animal.
She's a scream.
She's a real laugh.
She's always up for a party.
She's good company.
She loves to party.
Wish you were here.
Arrived safely.
Having a great time!
The food is wonderful.
The people are so friendly.
The weather's lovely.
Met some nice people.
We're off to the mountains tomorrow.
This is the life.
The place is a dump.
The journey was a nightmare.
We had a nightmare of a journey.
The food's disgusting.
I got food poisoning!
The people are so unfriendly.
It poured the whole time.
It's not what we expected.
Can't wait to get home.
There's nothing to do.
I'd much prefer to stay in
I'd much rather stay in
I'd go for an Indian meal any time.
I much prefer wine to lager.
Give me Italian wine any day.
If it was up to me, I'd choose London.
Going to a pub is more my kind of thing.
Given the choice, I'd rather stay in.
London would be preferable to Oxford.
The boys expressed a strong preference for
The UK Government claims that.
The UK Government alleges that.
They are trying to convince us that.
They are asserting that.
According to the government.
If the government is to be believed.
If they are to be believed.
Supposedly.
Apparently.
The so-called success of the project.
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
It'll be fine
What are you worrying for?
There's no need to worry.
There's nothing to worry about.
It'll turn out all right.
It isn't as bad as all that.
Whatever you may have heard.
Rest assured.
I can assure you that.
No way
Absolutely not
No Chance
Not if you paid me
Get lost
No, full stop
Not likely
I don't want to
I'd rather not
No but thanks for asking
I guess I'd better stop overspending.
I suppose I really ought to go to the gym
I really should diet, but then again.
There's nothing for it.
I'll have to do it
I promise I'll try harder to arrive early
I have every intention of passing the test
Never again will you catch me snoring.
Nothing is going to stop me finishing.
No matter what happens, I'm going to win.
Come hell or high water, I'll pay it back
In a word, no.
Not on your life.
Not likely.
Over my dead body.
Count me out.
I'd rather not if you don't mind.
I'd love to, but.
No chance.
Not on your nelly!
No way!
A bit annoyed.
A bit peeved.
Wound up.
None too pleased.
In a foul mood.
In a temper
Absolutely furious
Go through the roof
Go ballistic
Be on the warpath
Storm out
See red
She's absolutely delighted.
He's over the moon.
I'm dead chuffed.
He couldn't be happier.
We're very pleased.
She's on cloud nine.
I'm having a whale of a time.
He's loving every moment of it.
She's having the time of her life.
We're most satisfied.
A bit thick.
A bit dense
A total airhead.
Not all there.
A few bricks short of a full load.
Not the sharpest knife in the drawer
Thick as two short planks
Not accademically gifted
dimwit
Not the smartest.
That's a bit steep.
That's a bit pricey.
You paid a bit over the odds.
That's a bit on the dear side
It cost me an arm and a leg.
You're paying through the nose
That's exorbitant
It cost a fortune.
That's daylight robbery.
They must have seen you coming
I'm sure.
I'm absolutely positive.
I'm a hundred percent certain.
I'm utterly convinced.
I can assure you that.
I couldn't be more sure of.
I'd stake my life on it.
It's a known fact that.
Everybody knows that.
I can state categorically that.
You're having me on.
You're pulling my leg.
That's a bit of an exaggeration.
That's an outright lie.
That's a pack of lies.
That's a fishy story.
What you're saying is libellous.
That's a fib
That's stretching the truth a bit
What's the matter?
Are you all right?
What's getting you down?
What's up with you?
Why the long face?
You look a bit down.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Do you need a shoulder to cry on?
You look like you could do with a drink.
Oh you poor thing!
No doubt the Joneses will be there
It's unlikely that she'll come now
I bet that they'll be late
you can bet that they'll be late
I imagine that it'll be busy
The chances are that he'll win
There's no chance of them coming now
In all probability, it will be raining
My guess is that she'll lose
There's just a chance that it will work
I wouldn't be surprised if it rained
It was quite cheap.
It didn't cost that much.
It wasn't very expensive.
It wasn't that expensive, really.
It was quite reasonable, actually.
It was good value for money.
I thought it'd be more expensive.
I'm happy with the price.
That's a good price.
You pay a lot more in other places.
It was cheaper than usual.
It was discounted.
I got two for the price of one.
It was 20% off.
It was a real bargain.
It was on special offer.
They knocked £10 off the price.
It was reduced by £10.
It was in the sale.
I got it half-price

According to the weather forecast
Across many deserts
After many tries
Amid the confusion
Around the world
Before we start the meeting
Between a rock and a hard place
By the light of the moon
Like a beautiful swan
Near the ocean
Of my boss
Off the top
Out the door
Through the looking glass
Throughout the thick forest
To the amusement park
The book with the tattered cover has been read many times.
All the passengers aboard the runaway train were frightened.
The present inside the big box is mine.
Our boss put out a memo regarding the new rule.
The clues within the first few chapters will lead to the murderer.

The area outside the boundary is dangerous to cross.

Tell me the story about the dragon slayer.
Racing toward the finish line, she realized she just might win.
My shopping list needs to be put into my purse.
Without a GPS, we will lose our way.
Until today, I had never heard that.
The balloon drifted up the stairs.
Put the fresh flowers upon a high shelf.
Despite warnings, she tried to ski down.
Against all odds, our team won the tournament.
The tiger crept slowly over the grass.
We will order pizza during halftime.
I will climb up the highest mountain tomorrow.
I love to take my jeep off the road.
Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them.
We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.
There has to be evil so that good can prove its purity above it.
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.
I prefer winter and fall, when you feel the bone structure of the landscape.
Something waits beneath it.
The whole story doesn't show.
Don't walk behind me.
I may not lead.
Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow.
Just walk beside me and be my friend.
When you dance, your purpose is not to get to a certain place on the floor.
It's to enjoy each step along the way.

I am writing in reply to your letter of 4 September regarding your outstanding invoice.
Further to our conversation, I'm pleased to confirm our appointment for 9.30am on Tuesday, 7 January.
I would be grateful if you could attend to this matter as soon as possible.
If you would like any further information, please don't hesitate to contact me.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Dear Mr

Yours sincerely,

Dear Madam
Dear Sir or Madam
Yours faithfully,
I heard that people have to bargain whenever they go shopping in China.
Is that true?
You don't have to bargain when you go to a department store or a supermarket, but in most other places, you can try to get a better price.
We rarely do that in the States.
I'm not really sure how to do it.
Could you give me some pointers.
Sure, it's easy.
Anybody can do it.
The first thing you must do is some research.
Ask around and find out what a fair price is for what you want to buy.
When you know what a normal price is, you are ready to bargain.
That makes sense.
If I don't know what a fair price is, the seller can ask for any price, and I would probably pay it!
So, now I'm ready to go to a market.
What's next?
First, ask how much something is.
If the price is much higher than you're willing to pay, say so.
Then you ask for a lower price.
You should offer less than what you really want to pay.
That way, I can bargain up to my price, right?
Right!
The seller will make a counter-offer.
If you think it's still too high, and the seller refuses to go any lower, just walk away.
If the seller is really able to meet your price, he or she will call you back.
In that case, don't give in.
Keep trying to get your price.
What if the seller doesn't call me back?
You can alway try again with the next vendor.
If the seller's last price is not too high, you might accept it.
Just be sure you don't pay too much!
That seems pretty easy.
Bargaining sounds like a lot of fun!
It is!
And just like with learning a language, you'll get better at it the more you practice.
Hi.
I'm thinking of applying for a job with a multinational company, but I'm worried about having an interview in English.
Can you give me any good tips?
Hmmm.
That's a tough one.
I guess the first thing is to try to make a good impression.
We often say 
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
You really need to get off to a good start.
That sounds like good advice.
Maybe I could sing and dance for them, ha ha ha!
Then they'd really be impressed!
But seriously, how do I make a good first impression?
To begin with, you should firmly shake the interviewer's hand while greeting him or her with a smile.
Be sure to keep eye contact, especially when listening to the interviewer.
Body language is really important, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
The second thing is to have confidence.
You get confidence from being prepared.
You should learn a little bit about the company before the interview.
Find out what they do, how long they've been in business, what their business motto is, that kind of thing.
You should also anticipate possible questions, and think about how you will answer.
Should I memorize my answers beforehand?
No!
Definitely not!
That sounds very mechanical.
You should be natural when you speak.
Just think about how you want to answer, and choose the right words at the time of the interview.
That way, you can use the interviewer's own words in your answer, which shows you've been listening.
Then you're sure to make a good impression.
I never thought about that before.
You're really smart,!
But what should I do if I can't remember an English word when I'm answering a question?
In that case, you have to paraphrase.
In other words, you have to explain what you want to say.
For example, if you forget the word 
Or instead of 
you could say 
using many big numbers to describe something
That's very helpful.
Thanks so much.
Ah, one more thing.
Should I ask about the salary during the interview?
No, either let them bring up the topic of money, or else wait for a second interview.
If you prepare well, make a good first impression, have confidence, and use English naturally, you're almost certain to be interviewed again.
Good luck!
On the other hand, if you go directly, you won't stop along the way, which means you can spend more time at the Wall itself.
It's also cheaper.
I like to go off on my own.
I think going directly would be better for me.
Do you know how I can get there?
I've heard the cheapest way is by minibus number 919, which you can catch near the Jishuitan subway station.
It costs only 10 yuan!
There's also a train which starts on the west side of the city which goes directly to the Wall, but I've never taken it.
I know there's a small station outside the west gate of Beijing Aeronautics University.
You could go there and ask around.
That's very close to where I live, so I'll check it out!
By the way, have you ever been to the Great Wall?
Yes, I have.
It was VERY impressive!
Not only is it so long, but I was surprised at how steep the steps are.
It's almost like climbing a mountain!
The scenery from the wall is quite spectacular.
Looking out from the Wall, you can really get a sense of history.
Great!
I'm really looking forward to it.
So since you've been to the Great Wall, you are a true man, right?
Yes, now I drink lots of beer and even smoke cigars!
Really?!
Of course not, I'm just kidding!
Hi how was your day?
Hi I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?
I just had a very interesting experience.
I spent the whole day with dozens of little children!
That sounds like fun.
Yes, it was fun.
but exhausting!
Kids have so much energy.
Where did you meet all these kids?
At the primary school down the street.
I visited some of their classes in the morning, then taught them some simple English in the afternoon.
English must be very difficult for them.
Actually, they were very eager to learn.
I was quite impressed.
What did you teach them?
One teacher gave me some sentences to practice.
The kids love to repeat things out loud!
Sometimes I shouted the sentences, and they shouted back at me.
Other times I whispered, and they whispered back.
They were very cute.
Yes, I can imagine.
We also sang songs and played some English games together.
That's great.
You know, when I was in primary school, we never had English lessons.
How about in middle school?
We studied English, but only for a test.
It wasn't very practical.
You've managed to learn English very well.
I guess it's because you're a super student.
Ha ha ha.
Not me!
The kids you saw today seem to be much more super than I am.
They're the future of China.
Yes, they are, so China must have a bright future!
I wonder what this country will be like in 15 or 20 years when these kids are adults.
I really prepared thoroughly for this one.
I asked the interview a lot of tough questions about the company and the job, then I presented my ideas on how I would do the job.
What was their reaction?
I think I really impressed them.
They gave me a job right on the spot!
That's great!
What will you be doing for them?
I will have several duties to perform.
The first is to organize meetings.
Then I'll have to present plans to clients.
Do you mean that you will have to give speeches?
Yes, something like that.
I will give formal presentations.
I have to admit, I'm a bit nervous about that.
I'm sure you'll do fine, as long as you prepare as well as you prepared for the interview.
I'll have more to do than that.
I'll also have to follow-up through email or on the telephone.
I think I'm going to be very busy.
Do you have any tips for me?
You'll have to learn how to manage your time well.
How can I manage my time?
The first thing you have to do is prioritize.
It means to decide what should come first.
In other words, what are your most important tasks.
You should spend most of your time on the most important projects.
Oh yes, I've heard of that.
Isn't there a rule, something like the 80-20 rule?
Exactly!
Your most important projects will be about 20% of your total work, but they're so important that you should devote 80% of your time and effort to them.
The other tasks aren't so important, so they can be put off til later.
I see.
I can't put off the most important jobs, so I have to be sure to get those done no matter what.
I'm sure you'll do just fine in your new job.
When are you going to start?
In two weeks.
I'm really excited about it!
Exactly!
It's not very popular, so it won't be too crowded.
I enjoyed my trip to the Great Wall, but there were so many people there.
I think it spoiled the atmosphere a bit.
I'm sure Guizhou won't be so crowded.
But won't it be too hot in the summer?
No, according to one of my students, it's very cool in the summer.
He said it is naturally air conditioned.
Well that sounds good.
I wouldn't mind getting away from the heat myself.
Still, I wonder
Is there anything worth seeing in 
Sure!
For one thing, there's the beautiful natural scenery.
I'm sure you've heard of the Huang Guo Shu Waterfalls.
There's also the Maling Gorge which is said to be spectacular.
There are mountains everywhere in Guizhou, even in the capital city of Guiyang.
Yes, I have heard of Huang Guo Shu Pubu, but won't you get bored just looking at the scenery?
Come on there's lots of things to do.
I can go hiking in Qian Ling Park in Guiyang, visit Miao villages in the southeast, and I know you've heard of Zunyi, a very historical city.
It's where Mao Ze Dong first became the leader of the Red Army.
Gee, when you describe it like that, it sounds really interesting!
And that's not all.
I'll be able to eat very delicious, spicy food, drink world-famous maotai, and my student told me I can meet some very beautiful women there!
I'm sure you'll have fun but let me give you some advice.
Be sure to hold onto your wallet AND your heart!
We'll see what happens!
Do you have a place to stay in Guizhou?
Yes, I'm very lucky.
My student's sister is the manager of the Guizhou Park Hotel, the best hotel in the province.
I've seen some pictures on the Internet, it's really nice!
But I think outside Guiyang, I'll stay in a Miao village or maybe buy a tent and go camping.
That's great.
I'm looking forward to seeing your photos when you get back.
What do you like best about Shanghai?
Shanghai is the business center of China, so there are lots of jobs, and there's always something new.
It's more modern than Beijing and generally a convenient place to live.
Why would you want to stay in Beijing?
For one thing, Beijing has a sense of history about it.
You know, there's no Great Wall in Shanghai!
That's for sure.
There's no Forbidden City or Summer Palace, either.
For another thing, I think people are friendlier in Beijing.
Still, I think I'd like to marry a man from Shanghai.
But you just said people from Beijing are friendlier!
Yes, generally speaking.
But I've heard that men from Shanghai will help their wives with housework.
That's the kind of husband for me!
Yes, my teacher taught that to us.
I see.
That's right!
Oh, I think I need to take a break.
I'm exhausted!
We haven't gone very far.
How can I be so tired?
Maybe you should get more exercise.
You don't seem to be tired at all.
Why not?
It could be because I exercise regularly.
I play tennis three times a week.
That could be it.
We all need to keep our bodies in shape, don't we?
Wow, what a beautiful view!
Look to the east.
We can see the Summer Palace!
Oh, is that Kunming Lake?
Yes, it is.
And further out we can see the center of Beijing.
It sure is breathtaking!
I'm glad we came here on a clear day.
You know, I'm really glad I came to Beijing.
It's a very nice city, very liveable.
I'm really glad we came here today.
We've had a great time together!
But you need to get into better shape, so we can do this kind of thing more often.
I guess you're right.
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you teach me how to play tennis.
Then we can spend lots more time together!
That's for sure!
I've seen all of the great sites in and around Beijing, plus I visited Guizhou Province.
Not too many people from my hometown have been there before!
But how about you.
You must have done some special things in the past year.
Yes, I had a great year too, thanks to you,!
I've really learned how to do many things.
My English is better than it was.
You taught me how to succeed at a job interview.
You taught me how to play tennis.
Hey, it wasn't me!
You did it all yourself.
You should give yourself some credit for being such a good student.
Don't you think it's important to be modest?
Sometimes it is.
But sometimes you have to show confidence in your ability, too.
OK, I'll do my best.
Now, how about this year?
Have you made any special plans?
Many Americans make some special resolutions for the New Year, don't they?
Yes, I've made a couple of New Year's resolutions.
I've decided that this year I'm going to learn even more Chinese.
I hope I'll be able to speak fluently by the end of the year.
Also, I want to travel all around the country.
That will be fun.
You'll be able to practice Chinese while you travel.
Are there any special places you want to visit?
I want to go all over.
to the old capital city, Xi'an, to see the ice festival up north in Heilongjiang, to see the beautiful island of Hainan, and most of all, to visit Qingdao.
Why do you want to see Qingdao most of all?
Is it because of the old style buildings?
Or for the clean, sandy beaches?
Or maybe because it's famous for having the most beautiful women in China?
No, no, and no!
I want to go to Qingdao because of the beer!
You're silly,!
Well what about you?
What would you like to achieve this year?
Let's see.
I'd like to learn more English, so that I can watch movies and sing songs in English.
And I'd also like to improve my performance at work.
That shouldn't be too hard for you.
I mean, for such a good student and a hard worker.
Thank you.
It's very kind of you to say so!
Yes, they're all dancing.
I like the Chinese style music, but they're doing Western style dancing.
It seems a bit odd to me.
Are we going to dance today?
Not today - maybe when we get older!
Look beyond the dancers.
What do you see?
Hey, there's a little pond over there.
It looks very pleasant in the middle of a big city.
Let's go take a closer look.
I never knew there was a pond in the middle of Beijing.
Actually, there are SIX!
They're all man-made.
There are two ponds to the west of the Forbidden City called Nan Hai, which could be called South Pond and Zhong Hai, or Middle Pond.
The government offices surround those Ponds, so they're not open to the public.
To the north of those ponds is.
Let me guess.
It must be North Pond!
Good guess!
You're right, it's Bei Hai or I suppose we could say North Pond.
We could see Bei Hai if we went through that gate over there, but we would have to pay.
We can walk around the other three for free.
This one is called Qian Hai or Front Pond, then there's Hou Hai or Back Pond.
Finally, beyond Hou Hai is.
Let me guess again.
Is it Beyond Pond?
Another good guess.
But this time you're wrong!
The sixth one is a bit to the west, so it's called Xi Hai or West Pond.
Those people on the water seem to be having fun.
Can we rent a boat too?
Sure, but I don't feel like it today.
Let's do it another time.
OK.
What are those traditional style buildings on the other side of Qian Hai?
Those are restaurants and coffee shops.
We can go over there for a rest later if you want.
You know, I think this would be a good place to have a drink, especially on a Friday night after a long week at work.
Too bad there aren't any bars here.
Maybe we could open a bar here.
Isn't that a great idea?
Ha ha ha.
Somebody beat you to that idea.
There are over 40 bars around Hou Hai!
We'll go there some evening when you want to unwind, OK?
OK, it's a deal!
I think we call it 
It's named after you,!
Oh please.
Quit your teasing.
You taught me about Chinese kites, now I want to introduce you to this American tradition.
Ultimate Frisbee has really caught on as a sport since the 1970s.
Hey, look at that guy fly!
What a catch!
Jim isn't very tall, but he sure can run.
I saw someone just like him catch a frisbee on TV once, except it was a dog, not a man!
We're just warming up now.
Wait until the game starts.
Game?
What kind of game?
Ultimate Frisbee is a sport, similar to football or basketball.
We have seven players on each team.
They have to throw and catch the disc.
But we MUST catch the frisbee, or else the other team gets it.
So what's the goal of Ultimate Frisbee?
The goal is to catch the disc at the end of the field, beyond the goal line.
It sounds like a blast!
It is!
It's fun and good exercise too.
Are you up for it?
What??
You want ME to play?
Sure!
The best way to learn is to LEARN BY DOING!
Actually, we don't do much at Christmas.
It's not really a big family holiday.
Young people in China would rather spend Christmas Eve with their boyfriends or girlfriends.
So is it something like a date night?
Yes, I guess you could say that.
Christmas Eve is special, but we don't usually have any special plans for Christmas Day.
Don't people give gifts to each other like they do in the U.S.?
Many parents do give gifts to their kids.
But more importanly, boyfriends give wonderful, special, romantic gifts to their girlfriends!
I see.
How about the New Year in China.
Is it a bigger holiday than Christmas?
Not really.
We don't celebrate it because the Spring Festival is much more important to us here in China.
The Spring Festival is known around the world as Chinese New Year.
It's the beginning of the year according to the traditional lunar calendar, isn't it?
That's right.
The Spring Festival is the biggest family holiday in China, so we don't celebrate the western New Year.
How about in New York?
Do people celebrate New Year's Eve more or New Year's Day?
There are two kinds of people who celebrate quite differently.
Single people, or couples without children, often go out late on New Year's Eve.
They drink and party after the clock strikes midnight.
There are big parties all over, but the biggest is in Times Square in Manhattan.
I guess they won't have much energy left over to do anything on New Year's Day, then.
Right.
But there are families who don't do anything special on New Year's Eve.
Instead, they celebrate with their families on New Year's Day.
What do they do on New Year's Day?
They have a big meal to celebrate and often watch parades in the big cities.
The parades are quite spectacular.
It sounds a little bit like our traditional Lion Dance.
Yes, it's a lot like the Lion Dance, except there is no lion!
Hi how's the new job going?
It's very exciting and I'm really learning a lot.
At the same time, it's also quite tiring.
I need a break today.
How about if we go to lunch together?
No, I want to do something more active.
I have an idea.
Why don't we go to the park and fly a kite!
Are you kidding?
No, I'm serious.
Flying kites is an ancient tradition here.
Look, I have this kite my uncle gave me.
Hey, it's a butterfly.
It must look really cool flying high in the sky!
So, are you up for it?
OK.
But where can we fly a kite in such a big city?
We can go just down the street, at the Workers Stadium.
You can fly kites in the stadium?
Well not exactly.
But we can fly them in the parking lot.
Let's go!
OK, I'm right behind you!
(Twenty minutes later, they arrive at the north gate of the Workers Stadium.)
Wow!
So many kites!
Watch your step!
Don't get run over by the rollerskaters.
I have to watch out for those football players too!
I didn't know this is such a popular place.
I used to come here as a kid to play, and at night my mother and grandmother sometimes came to dance.
All of these kites are really beautiful.
Look at that long one over there.
It looks like a dragon to me.
That's right, it is.
The dragon is really impressive, but I prefer the bird kite over there.
Don't you think it's amazingly graceful?
Yes, it looks like a real bird flying!
It obviously takes real skill to fly these special kites.
I'm eager to see your butterfly up among the clouds.
OK, hold onto the kite while I get the string ready.
On the count of three, let go.
Here we go!
Yes, it's been quite a while.
So, you must be thinking about how happy you'll be to see them again.
Yes, that's true.
But I'm also thinking about what kinds of gifts I should bring back from China for everyone - my brother, my sister, her husband and daughter, and of course, for my parents.
Of course, you want to bring back some traditional things.
How about some Chinese kites?
Hey, that's a good idea!
You and I had a lot of fun flying kites together.
I'm sure my niece would get a kick out of flying a Chinese-style kites too.
And maybe you could bring back some masks from the Beijing Opera.
you're a genius!
Beijing Opera masks are not only very colorful, they're very exotic too!
My parents will really like them.
OK, now I have to think of something to buy my sister.
That's a tough one!
Don't be so pessimistic.
Does she like exotic fashions?
Maybe you could bring back a qipao, a traditional Chinese dress.
Of course!
Another great idea!
How do you think of these ideas so easily,?
Hey, you said it before.
I'm a genius!
Ha ha ha.
OK, now the toughest people to shop for - my brother and my sister's husband.
What in the world could I bring back for them?
Didn't you tell me that your brother is studying Chinese now?
Yes, that's right.
He hopes to come to China after he graduates from university.
So why not buy him a DVD so that he can watch a movie in Chinese?
Sure, he'd love that.
He's crazy about kung fu movies, so he can have fun and learn at the same time!
You amaze me.
Geniuses will do that!
OK, now for your brother-in-law.
I think you're on your own there!
I could just get him a t-shirt.
Or maybe he'd like a Chinese kite too.
Or maybe a kung fu DVD.
Right, or maybe a qipao!
That's a silly idea!
!
Yes, you're right.
He's much too fat to wear a qipao!
Hi what's wrong?
You look a bit under the weather.
I'm not feeling very well.
I seem to be coming down with another cold.
Not again!
You had a cold last month, and the month before that, too.
Well there's not much I can do about it.
I'm not sick on purpose.
All I can do is take some medicine and take it easy.
Would you mind if I made a suggestion?
No, I don't mind.
Go ahead.
Maybe you should try some traditional Chinese medicine.
If it can help me get rid of this cold, I'd be willing to give it a shot.
Actually, it might not make a difference with this cold, but it can make your whole body stronger so you won't catch so many colds.
What's so special about traditional Chinese medicine?
One special point is that it's all natural.
Chinese medicine is made from plants, not chemicals, which means there are few side-effects.
That's a big advantage.
Some people can't stand the thought of taking medicine because of all the chemicals.
Another advantage is that Chinese medicine works slowly, so it keeps your body healthy in the long run.
That sounds like just what I need!
But, how does traditional Chinese medicine work?
Basically, it helps balance two opposing forces in your body.
If you have either too much Yin or too much Yang, your body is out of balance, and you are more likely to get sick.
The purpose of traditional Chinese medicine is to put Yin and Yang back in balance.
I see.
So how can I get my hands on some Chinese medicine.
Can I buy it in any pharmacy?
First, you should be examined by a traditional doctor.
I know a good doctor just around the corner.
I'm a bit afraid.
Will he give me any shots or anything like that?
Don't be afraid.
The doctor will just feel your pulse and check the color of your tongue.
It's very simple and painless!
Great!
I have some free time at the end of next week.
How's your schedule on Thursday or Friday?
I'm free both days.
I'll call the doctor to set up an appointment, then let you know what has been decided.
That's wonderful.
It should be a very interesting experience for me.
Not me!
I'm very shy, especially in front of a group of strangers.
Hey, my friends aren't strange!
people I don't know
It doesn't mean they are strange!
Was it easy for you to sing the first time you went to karaoke?
For me it was very easy, I love to sing!
But now that you mention it, some of my friends were very shy the first time they went.
One of my friends says he has to have some beer before he can sing in front of people.
Maybe you should have one or two drinks before singing.
One or two beers might help.
or twenty!
Does that mean you'll come?
OK, I'll give it a try.
At the karaoke club.
Oh, it's a private room!
I thought we'd be singing in a crowded bar or restaurant.
No, we have this all to ourselves.
That will make it easier maybe.
Now, how does this work?
It's simple.
Just choose a song and sing.
Do you know 
Sure, everybody knows it.
Great, here it comes now!
Good luck!
What do you mean?
I'm not ready to sing yet.
I haven't even had one beer!
You'll just have to do your best.
You know what they say 
Just do it!
Two hours later.
How many songs have you sung?
Oh, at least 10.
I think it's been more like 20.
Time to go home!
Time to go home?
But we're just getting started.
Let's stay half an hour more.
Sorry, we have to go to work in the morning and you have to study.
We'll come back some other night.
Great!
How about tommorrow?
Hey is there anything I need to know about taking a taxi in Beijing?
Well it’s pretty easy.
The first thing you have to do is to signal by holding your hand out.
Next, you should find the right taxi.
If you want to save money, you should find a taxi that charges only 1.20 (“one point two”) yuan per kilometer.
If you want a more comfortable taxi, you can pay 1.60 yuan.
The price is printed on a label shown in the back window of each taxi.
OK.
So what do I do after I get in the taxi?
Of course, you should greet the driver and tell him where you want to go.
After he starts driving, make sure he turns on the meter.
What should I do if he can’t find my destination?
Then you have to give him directions.
Tell him to turn left or right.
That’s “zou guai” or “you guai” in Chinese.
Or tell him to keep going straight, “yizhi wang qian zou”.
Got it!
Then I guess all I have to do is pay the driver and say “good-bye”, right?
Well not quite.
You should always ask for a receipt, which is printed out for every customer.
That way, if you forget something in the taxi, you can get it back with no problem.
Thanks that’s a big help!
What?
You mean you've been to the Olympics before?
Yes, I spent a few days in Atlanta in '96, and I saw the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan in '98 too.
You can see so many different people, hear different languages, do all kinds of things.
You can even see some sports if you really want to!
Ha ha ha.
You're really funny.
So did you see many events?
Actually, I didn't see so many.
Believe it or not, it's better to watch the sports events at home.
It's more comfortable, you can see the games up close, and you get different camera angles.
Unless you can get good seats, watching in person isn't nearly as good.
That sounds very disappointing!
Why should anyone go to see the Olympics?
It's not disappointing at all.
The atmosphere is what makes it all worthwhile.
Also, I got into collecting and trading Olympic pins when I was there.
You can trade pins with people from all over the world.
I now have pins from more than 20 different countries.
It's a fun way to meet all kinds of people.
Did you meet any athletes?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I met some of the Chinese women ice hockey players when I was in Japan.
They gave me this China pin in exchange for an American pin.
I think I'd like to have a Beijing 2008 Olympic pin!
I wonder where I can get one?
Well I just happen to have one right here.
Really?
Can I have it?
Sure.
What do you have to trade for it???
Hey is there anything I need to know about taking a taxi in Beijing?
Well it’s pretty easy.
The first thing you have to do is to signal by holding your hand out.
Next, you should find the right taxi.
If you want to save money, you should find a taxi that charges only 1.20 (“one point two”) yuan per kilometer.
If you want a more comfortable taxi, you can pay 1.60 yuan.
The price is printed on a label shown in the back window of each taxi.
OK.
So what do I do after I get in the taxi?
Of course, you should greet the driver and tell him where you want to go.
After he starts driving, make sure he turns on the meter.
What should I do if he can’t find my destination?
Then you have to give him directions.
Tell him to turn left or right.
That’s “zou guai” or “you guai” in Chinese.
Or tell him to keep going straight, “yizhi wang qian zou”.
Got it!
Then I guess all I have to do is pay the driver and say “good-bye”, right?
Well not quite.
You should always ask for a receipt, which is printed out for every customer.
That way, if you forget something in the taxi, you can get it back with no problem.
Thanks that’s a big help!
I remember.
You told me hitting a forehand, starting on my right, is like hitting a ping pong ball.
Exactly.
Why don't you try one now.
Ready?
Hit this!
Oops!
I missed it completely!
That's OK, try again.
This time, keep your eye on the ball.
Keep my eye where?
It's just an expression.
Keep your eye on the ball means watch the ball carefully.
Oh, I see.
Let me try again.
Here comes another ball.
Wow!
You hit it over the fence!
You're a very powerful lady.
Hee hee hee.
I guess I need to practice more.
Sure, but with a bit of practice, you'll be able to keep the ball in the court.
Now what about the backhand?
Many people think the backhand is difficult, but actually it's quite simple.
It's a lot like slapping your boyfriend in the face!
Huh?
What do you mean?
Just pull your racket back to your left, then imagine you see your boyfriend with another woman!
Why that dirty rat!
Let's just take a couple of regular pictures, then you can get back to your masterpiece.
Oh, OK.
Stand to the left of that tree and strike a glamorous pose.
Glamorous?
Hmmm, OK.
How's this?
Just hurry up snap the picture, I can't stand on one leg all day!
OK, say cheese.
Got it!
Now let me take one of you.
Oh no!
This is taking way too much time.
Besides, it might break the camera.
I'll be careful, I promise.
No, I don't mean you.
I mean my funny face will crack the camera lens!
Don't be silly.
Come on, give me the camera.
OK, what do I do?
Wait until you see me in the middle of the picture and make sure I'm in focus.
Then just click the shutter, right here.
It's as easy as taking candy from a baby.
Huh?
Why would I want to do that?
It's just an expression.
Well OK.
Anyway, here goes 
Good.
I'm glad that's over with.
Now we need to take a picture of both of us together.
It will be such a wonderful memory!
We just have to find someone to take it for us.
Oh no, when will this ever end?
Ha ha ha.
That would be interesting to see you writing your lessons at the beach!
Anyway, I'm sure you can find what you want here.
In this building they sell nothing but electronics and computers.
I see so many new building under construction here.
I wonder what they will be.
They will probably be office buildings for hi-tech companies.
This part of Beijing is called China's Silicon Valley.
Oh, I didn't know that!
Let's go inside and take a look.
Hey, look at all the cool stuff here!
Hmmm.
Maybe I should buy an MP3 player while I'm here.
Or maybe a new mobile phone.
Come on.
We had better go upstairs or you'll spend all of your money before we even SEE the computers!
OK.
Which floor are the computers on?
Let's see, there's a sign over here.
They're on the 3rd and 4th floors.
What brand do you want to buy?
I think I'd like to buy a SONY.
You can't beat the quality!
Yes, and SONY products are usually small and light.
Hey, here are some SONY computers.
Why don't you ask the price.
This is your chance to practice your bargaining skills.
Can we bargain in a big electronics store?
I had no idea.
Yes you can, but you have to be good!
I'm sure you can do it.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Here goes nothing.
Uh, excuse me, could you tell me how much this computer is.
It's also near the zoo and the National Library.
Next you have to think about rent.
What price range are you thinking about?
I really can't pay more than 1500 a month, but I'd like to pay 1000 if possible.
What if you find a perfect apartment for 1800 or 2000, something really beautiful.
Would you take it?
No, I really can't afford to pay that much.
1500 yuan is definitely my limit.
I think 1000 is possible if you have a roommate.
You could share an apartment with a college student, or maybe a young worker.
That might be interesting, but I really like my privacy.
I need to study Chinese in a quiet place and also sleep in peace every night.
Maybe it's best for you to pay a little bit more for your own apartment.
So, the next step is to decide what kind of apartment you want - how many rooms, what kind of furnishings, stuff like that.
I don't need any special furnishings, but I certainly want a southern exposure.
I like to have a bright, sunny room.
One bedroom and one living room is enough, but I really want to have a balcony.
That should be easy to find.
Most apartment buildings have rooms facing south, usually with a balcony.
But if you only want to pay 1500 yuan, maybe you will only have one room, not two.
I see.
That's a bit small compared to my apartment in New York.
But I guess Beijing is more crowded.
Maybe we'll get lucky and find something bigger.
Let's wait and see.
OK, now that I know what I want, what do I have to do to actually find an apartment?
I'll look through some advertisements and make some phone calls.
Then we can go check out the ones that sound good.
That's great.
I'm really looking forward to having a nice, new apartment!
Yes, a sunny new apartment!
I reckon.
Personally, I think.
What I reckon is.
If you ask me.
The way I see it.
As far as I'm concerned.
If you don't mind me saying.
I'm utterly convinced that.
In my humble opinion 
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Ever so sorry.
How stupid of me.
How careless of me.
How thoughtless of me.
Pardon me.
That's my fault.
Sorry.
It was all my fault.
Please excuse my ignorance
Please dont be mad at me.
Please accept our apologies.
I'm not sure about that!
You could be right, but.
I'm afraid I dont agree.
I agree up to a point, but 
That's an interesting idea, but 
Do you really think 
Rubbish!
Nonsense!
You can't be serious!
Actually, as a matter of fact.
I think 
That's not how I see it.
No way
Absolutely not
No Chance
Not if you paid me
Get lost
Not likely
I dont want to
I'd rather not
No but thanks for asking

So, what are your plans for this weekend?
I don't know.
Do you want to get together or something?
How about going to see a movie?
Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.
That sounds like a good idea.
Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.
It is fine with me.
Where do you want to meet?
Let's meet at Summer Pizza House.
I have not gone there for a long time.
Good idea again.
I heard they just came up with a new pizza.
It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.
When should we meet?
The movie is shown at 2 pm, 4 pm, 6 pm and 8 pm.
Why don't we go to the 2 pm show?
We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon.
That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.
My cousin is in town.
Can I bring her along?
I hate to leave her home alone.
She is in town?
Yes, bring her along.
Do you remember her?
We met her at her high school graduation party two years ago.
I do not quite remember her.
What does she look like?
She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.
She wears eyeglasses, right?
Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.
I remember her now.
Bring her along.
She is such a nice person, and funny too.
She will be happy to meet both of you again.
What is she doing these days?
She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.
What grade is she going to teach?
She will teach kindergarten.
She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them.
Kindergarten?
She must be a very patient person.
I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach.
Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have never been away from mommy for long.
I think she will do fine.
She knows how to handle young children.
I think the first few weeks will be tough.
However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.
You are right.
The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.
There are so many new things for them to do at school too.
They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten.
I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do.
Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.
Maybe we can ask her to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.
Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie.
What do you think?
I will talk to her.
I think she will like that.
It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.
Michael's is a good store for crafts.
It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.
There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26.
I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue.
We can even walk over there.
So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael's afterward.
Right?

I am at a crossroads in my life.
I felt my face crumple.
I decorate my house.
It was my memorable moment.
I love virtual happiness.
I'm going to prove it.
I have a surprise for you.
Can you prove that I am wrong?
How long will it last?
They're mainly competitions.
Don't rush off, i have not finished.
Isolated rural locations
I use a bus and train to commute to school.
I mainly watch romantic comedies.
I'm leaving.
I've had enough of all this nonsense!
Is your translation correct?
I'll transfer your call.
It comes to nothing.
I appreciated you doing that.
I have to make dinner in the evening.
It depends.
It's a symbol of the city.
I'll show you the way.
I'm really fortunate to have such good friends.
I'll wake you up at 6 sharp tomorrow morning.
I can't keep up with you.
It's a waste of time.
I must go now.
I could not sleep all night long.
I really feel horny.
I have to differ with you on that.
It's only a matter of time.
I feel a bit down at the moment.
I'm feeling very dozy this afternoon.
I'm sorry to take up your time.
I'm on my way.
I'm sorry, I intended no offence when I said that.
I intended not to eat dinner, but I change my mind.
I want to do something to cheer up my wife.
It won't be long.
I'm actually really scared.
I'm happy with what I have.
It is not a bilingual book.
I was just daydreaming.
I give in.
It might be more prudent to get a second opinion before going ahead.
I tried to win her affection.
I usually do morning exercise to keep myself in good shape.
It usually takes me an hour to check and reply email.
I work hard, and I think I deserve to be well paid.
I haven't seen you for a while.
How have you been?
I need to sort out the mess on my desk.
I will never abandon hope.
I need a bilingual dictionary.
I wouldn't trade you my job for anything.
I feel a tiny bit better today.
I intended to go but forgot to.
I'm taking it step by step to achieve my goals.
I've actually done it!
I tried and failed.
I'd leave that job immediately if I were in his shoes.
If you don't make it snappy, we'll miss the train.
I suppose she might.
I commute from Oxford to London every day.
It is the first step that costs.
I go to the cinema very often.
If you're busy, then so be it.
I take it everywhere with me.
I suppose they're right.
I've done my best.
I have a period of time like yours.
I don't like anyone cheating on me.
I need to recruit staff.
I'm single and available.
I have been ill since yesterday.
It is too blurry.
I suppose it can't be helped.
I'm fed up with living in the sticks.
It was indeed a memorable day.
It's just food poisoning.
I am behind you.
It's a violent film.
I am trying to change some habits.
I've been going out with him for two months.
I do not complain, even if my heart breaks.
I have a passion for work.
I didn't catch your name.
I feel blue.
I am in a hurry.
It can't be helped.
It makes me really upset.
I believe that my fate will be changed by me.
I myself prefer an independent life.
It's a memorable lesson.
I am on my way home.
I suppose.
I'm going out of my mind!
It's time for plain speaking.
I've been swamped.

That sounds not bad at all.
That's why I didn't show up on time, either.
Take him!
This bus transfer has expired.
That's the way we've always done it.
Take it as it comes.
That's a dirty lie.

She's very practical.
She arrived out of the blue.
She took away my reputation.
So whether you agree with it or not, it does not matter to me.

Just once!
United we stand, divided we fall.
Unfortunately in reality this is not always the case.
About a year ago, I found out I was having a son.
I instantly became the proud papa.
Puffed out my chest, bought a new camera.
The height of my expectation was almost surreal.
But then I realized I couldn't imagine what to expect.
I have two daughters, so I'm not a new father.
But I've never had a son before and somehow it seemed different.
Here I am as a boy, I had dreams as a boy and I faced obstacles as a boy.
I had some idea of what life as a boy would be like and it certainly wasn't easy.
I realized I didn't exactly know how I would prepare him for it all.
Around that same time, I got a phone call.
I have an old friend, and by old I mean I've known him for a while.
But he's also almost twice my age.
While I was facing all these questions around having a son, he called to tell me he was retiring from his job, which is a big milestone on a man's journey.
This is Hank.
I thought it would be dramatic and profound to have him walking through the woods.
Friendships are funny.
Sometimes the most unlikely people make the most important companions.
Hank has had a good life.
He's married with two daughters and has had a prolific career.
But as he reflected on his life, he realized that one of the most important parts of his life was the friends he'd made along the way.
He wanted to tell that story.
I should mention here that we did discuss him using snowshoes at one point.
As we talked about friendship, Hank said that male intimacy is important.
I said.
I think we should find a different word.
But that's when I realized that men talking about their relationships was actually a little risky.
Men sharing their lives with one another and revealing their fears and dreams to each other was something we don't often see.
I knew I had to help him tell that story.
I discovered some interesting things, some honestly shocking things, and some things I could use to help teach another young man what I now realize is one of the most important things to know.
To help me better understand Hank's friendships, and navigate this delicate subject of male intimacy, I turned to some experts.
Kimmel is a sociologist at SUNY Stony Brook.
He specializes in men and masculinity, having written twenty books on the subject.
What we witnessed in the 19th century, in the Untied States and Europe, was what one sociologist calls the feminization of love.
Where, when you have the separate spheres, man goes off into the work place, the competitive place, he has to guard himself, he has to be hard as nails, he can show no feelings, he can show no weakness.
And woman, in the home, they get to be with children, they get to make it a, you know sort of a, she's the angle in the house, as Virginia Woolf said.
She becomes the guardian of emotion.
He's the guardian of rationality.
And that idea that we have these two models that we're Martian and Venutian is a relatively recent one.
Alan Frow was a pastor in Southern California, who speaks around the world, often to groups of men in a variety of cultures.
True friendship is being vulnerable enough to say
I need help in this area.
I might have it together in some areas but not in this one, can you help?
I think woman are much better at doing that than guys.
Friendships between men, or in pop culture terms the bromance, has actually gotten a lot of attention these days.
Zoe, here's the deal, Peter's always been a girlfriend guy.
He put all his focus and energy
into his relationships and all his dude friends just fell by the way side.
Zoe, don't listen to him, all right?
We're 8 years apart.
Barely grew up together in the same house.
This is ridiculous, why is it weird that I had girlfriends?
Nothing, we're just saying that you never really had a best friend is all.
Who is your best friend?
I have two.
Hank Mardukas has been my closest friend since our first year at IBM, best man at our wedding.
Yea, yea he was
Talk to him two, three times a week on the phone for 30 years now.
Robby.
What's up?
Robby is your other best friend?
Correct.
And Hank Mardukass.
And then there's
The importance of other men to travel with through life wasn't even on my radar when it came to having a son.
But society at large seems to be asking some key questions.
It appears that I'm not the only on a bit of a quest.
I honestly can think of probably a half a dozen people that I've had this conversation with since this whole subject came up some time ago.
And probably the over arching reaction is
I just have never really thought about the depth, or lack there of, of my male relationships.
So I don't think it's, I don't think it's on their mind, I don't think most of these guys have been losing sleep over it.
But when you present them with the
Have you ever thought?
What are you getting and not getting from your male friendships?
It usually engenders some
Wow, I haven't really though of that, but you're on to something.
Try the beach?
Whoa.
Now the wind's picked up.
Big storms, I told you it was cold.
You never listen to me.
Yeah but
When I came in it wasn't this windy.
So, the storm is supposed to be here in two or three hours, right?
Yep.
I first met Hank.
Maybe seven years ago now.
And he was at the bank and I was doing my consulting thing, and we were introduced by a neat lady, a mutual acquaintance, and I liked him right away.
You know, he's sort of irreverent.
God knows he's strange looking.
This one might work, because we're going to have a contest.
I'll try to find you a bigger set of stones.
Ok pick, pick your, pick your stones.
But you obviously don't know what you're doing.
You have to have flat stones to skip.
These work though.
Oh come on, these are good.
You, you probably grew up in the city, didn't you?
Jim is a person who says what I think, and I'm afraid to say it.
And, it just comes out of his mouth and it sounds so much better than I could ever say it.
And his energy is contagious.
He's just this very energetic person who has great emotional intelligence and has been unbelievably successful in New York business.
I see some real roadblocks for men developing these kinds of relationships, especially if they have to stem from the work place because it's not conducive, not conducive.
It takes trust, generally speaking, an aura of trust and trust of that specific person.
And I think, without sounding too negative of, sort of the American work place, you know there is, there is maybe rightly not a presence of great trust.
I think you; it's a competitive environment.
You know I get ahead by doing great things but I also get ahead by making sure other people don't get ahead in many cases.
So I think you're hesitant to share deep, vulnerable, exposing aspects of yourself with other people because it may be an admission of weakness.
You may be arming them frankly, you know, to use the information against you.
To be a man means to be in control.
To be a man mean have everything organized, to have everything together.
To disclose how you don't, how you have questions, how you're confused.
I mean look at the way we imagine woman's friendships.
They're always talking about how they don't have it together, can't figure men out, what am I suppose to wear here, what should I do about my career, how should I be managing al this.
They're constantly talking about how they don't have it together.
I wanted to kill him.
And he's standing there giving me the
What's the big problem?
You know I don't understand you, like it's my problem.
OK just calm down.
There are ways to make this work, it's just seven months and you can go visit him in Paris and can come back here.
No, it's not about that.
It's about the fact that I wasn't even a factor in his decision making process.
Totally.
Men do this all the time.
I mean, just tell me what's going on.
Is that too much to ask?
Carey, I'm thinking about going to France for the rest of my life.
Am I right?
Totally.
You know one minute he's all over me and the next minute he's pushing me away, and I just, I just cannot believe this [Bang] is happening again!
Yes, all right, calm down.
There'll be no breaking of things.
Why do I keep doing this to myself?
I must be a masochist or something.
Now imagine a you going out to dinner with your three best male friends.
Do you sit around and say
I can't figure this out.
I can't figure out women, I can't figure out like what to do with my career.
No, because then, you know, the other guys, their response will be
What a weenie.
Talk to me about how tough that, being Mr.
Mom and taking care of Julia all these months has been.
Well I'm not sure I rose to the occasion all the time to be honest, it was.
You know at times it was frankly it was just an imposition.
It was tough.
Because you're trying to do the right thing, but you still need to carve out time for yourself and my piece of the family didn't go away, which is to go out and make a living.
And the logistics got very tough with the four kids, you know in a given week, I mean literally in a given week we probably have 23 things going on between gymnastics and ballet and something at school and extra help and swimming and, you just.
You're in the car, and you're back, and in the car, and I get exhausted by the middle of the evening and then you got to hunker down and do three hours of work that you didn't do during the day.
And physically, I mean I've been tired for the past couple months so I'm trying to work out a little bit more, and just keep my energy level up, because honestly it's been hard.
I'm glad it's.
I'm glad this piece is coming to an end.
Because every time we talk I could tell this was really tough for you.
It's been tough.
There's something about the nature of Hank, and I guess maybe how we interacted by definition, that allowed us very quickly and comfortably, to segue work only, watch what you're saying, don't be too vulnerable, to sharing things on a personal level, to then find you're sharing almost anything.
I mean, I don't even process
Gee there's something on my mind, but would I.
You know would I talk to Hank about it?
Would I share it with Hank?
I don't even go through those filters, so something happened logically.
I mean, you don't process this, you don't work on it.
Something happened logically where you just went from a, you meet a new guy, there's a rapport, there's a trust, and suddenly you're sharing anything that's on your mind without thinking about it.
We would have a meeting set up on a Thursday in June, he'd call me up and say,
Do you want to meet for lunch or do you want to come out on the boat?
And let's do it on the boat.
And we began to blend it slowly.
And the more we did it the more we liked it, and it just began to evolve with our wives [begging] to get together, and we broke the boundary.
As you get a little bit older and you've done this dance, you start to sense in somebody else, I mean your accuracy is not one hundred percent, but you start to sense in somebody else the potential receptivity, so then you kind of put out more with the expectation with it's probably going to come back.
And our instincts say, in this case, this guy is special, he's different, or at minimum he's more like me and I have a fair degree of confidence that what I put out he'll pick up, he'll put it out and I'll pick it up.
A lot of the people I work with don't approve of the personal relationship in the business relationship.
I happen to think business works better that way, but a lot of people don't.
At a point when he got fired I think one of the reasons is people didn't appreciate everything about him, and so they let him go but they didn't tell me.
One day I was leaving his house and as I was saying goodbye to Jim he said to me,
Hey Hank, I love you.
Can we say that now?
And I looked at him and I said 
I think we can say that now because I love you.
And now every time we see each other you know we hug, sometimes we kiss on the cheek, you know European style.
And, and we say
I love you
Guys, they'll say
Love you bro
But the moment you say
I love you and you don't put
on the other side it's like.
go to a guy and say I love you
It's like no no no no that, you have to say, love you bro
and I think that's just something of this politic of men working out what is appropriate and what is not.
And I think at the back of our minds is designed not step over that line but deep down every single one of us need genuine male friendships.
It's so wonderful for another man to say that to me and then for me to feel it back.
It's a gift.
As I get older I find I'm spending a lot less time thinking about the future because it just worries me that there's not a lot of it.
When I think of a guy like Hank it's a given in my mind that we'll know each other and we'll be close literally for the rest of our lives.
Shall we head back in?
I think so.
I've had enough of this warmth.
We've gotten our exercise for the day.
Felt good though.
It's true as they say, that men are mostly competitive at work and friendships only go so deep.
Even guys who hangout together are often one-upping each other.
So how do these relationships begin?
How does this dance, as Jim calls it, really work?
So what do I do?
I mean, how do I meet friends?
It's such a weird concept.
I can do some recon around the gym.
But you're going to have to be aggressive about this man.
Use the internet to meet guys.
Get mom to fix you up.
I mean if you see a cool looking guy strike up a conversation and ask him on a man date.
A what?
A man date.
You know what I mean?
No.
By that I mean casual lunch or after work drinks, OK.
No dinner and no movies.
You're not taking these boys to see
The Devil Wears Prada
Oh God I love that movie.
No I won't, I got you, I know what you mean.
This is really exciting.
We're going to find you some friends.
I've never heard men talk about this.
But these relationships are difficult to initiate.
Especially as you get older.
I hate this.
There's no rules for male friendships.
What are you freaking out about?
You went out with those other guys.
I'm really nervous about this one.
Because you really like him.
Men's friendships tend to be more episodic not existential, not taken through the life course, but episodic.
You're really great friends with guys from high school.
You're going to be best friends for ever.
Then you off to college, not so much.
Then you have your college bros.
And your bros in college are your best friends and you're going to stay together forever and you're bros before hoes, and you know, you're just, you know bond forever.
And pretty soon you leave, you get married, you get a job, and your new friends in your work place are the guys you spend your weekends with.
And once a year you go back to the college for a weekend of drunken revelry where you remember that those were your bros and you stay connected to them.
And then your next group of friends is the next work place and you don't necessarily take them with you.
The fact that we retained a relationship over time is very, very strange because we are almost polar, in a general sense, polar opposite.
Black, white, Baptist heritage, Jewish heritage
everything about us is so completely different which means, it could mean that these things would separate us, but as it turns out these are the things that we could learn from one another.
That made a very rich group of things we could learn from one another if we have that trust element.
The trust is needed to learn from someone else and I think we had that.
I really appreciate where Bob's been in his life and where we are and where we've been over these forty years.
I don't expect him to be like me, to communicate like me, and he doesn't expect me to communicate like him.
And as long as we're willing to meet in the middle - have balance in the relationship - it works pretty darn well.
Cross-cultural relationships are pretty powerful.
When we hang around with people that have had very different life experiences it shines a totally different light on where we're at.
There's something about being black in the world in the sixties that would be impossible for anybody who's not black in the world in the sixties to understand.
Also, what's important to you is different based upon where you stand, depends upon on many issues, depends upon where you sit.
And so I have to accept where he's coming from and what his world is like, and he had to accept that from me.
I was going through a divorce, which [was an] extremely painful experience for me and I had no idea what to do next.
And he offered to let me stay in his house.
I said,
I'm not staying at any white guys house.
When we were living together I had a date in the house and he streaked through the living room.
When I saw that black ass running through my living room, the girl turned to me and said,
What was that?
I said,
My roommate.
Differences can produce problems and differences can provide opportunities.
I think we've both chosen to see it more as an opportunity rather than obstacle.
Help me with a problem.
I went out and I saw Brianna.
And, Brizer is almost 29 now.
Right, so as a parent I don't have very much control anymore right.
You have no control.
No control.
She's out in California, she's been there now for a lot of years, right.
She just got a promotion in the company she works for so she's now an assistant manager.
Which is great.
And she's in love.
They've been dating now for a year, just about.
And I have concerns about him.
Oh boy.
There's something unique about being a man, being loved by a man, being helped by a man, and growing with a man, and a man who constantly, constantly, and this is true of other men, constantly, constantly reinforce who you are but yet help you become better than you are.
What comes to my mind, you explain how you feel to her.
Exactly.
Exactly.
And then you behave in a loving way toward him.
As long as she understands.
That's the hard part.
But, that's saying,
I love her.
So that's what's most important to me right now.
So I want to make sure I'm in the position.
She gonna make mistakes like I did?
Absolutely.
I want to make sure that at the end of that I can be as helpful to her as possible and that I still maintain my relationship.
I said to her,
I wish when I got married the first time one of my parents said to me,
Why are you doing this you crazy.
Don't do this.
Why, would you have listened too?
I probably wouldn't have.
But I still wanted someone to say it.
As I look back, I wish someone had said it, you know.
And so I have my own kind of failed marriage mixed up into this, as well as dealing with Brianna's situation.
It was not part of my style to talk about personal stuff about myself to my friends.
But it was for Hank to do that and so since he could do it, I could do it with him.
Those discussions were about things what's important in life, what's missing in me, what do I need, what do I want, what my fears are and that sort of thing.
I'm not sure whether Hank did that with other people or not but I didn't.
These guys have known each other for longer than I've been alive.
And given the length of their lives it's no surprise that they've begun to consider and even plan for death.
At first I found it morbid, but then realized it's quite intimate.
You might want to tell me, and I might want to tell you some things that I want you to do at my funeral or your funeral.
I'll send you my stuff.
You can send me yours.
I've written this stuff up already.
Hold on, wait a minute.
You've written my speech?
What do you mean you've written stuff?
I've written stuff for you, for your speech.
For my speech?
That's what I'm saying; you've written my speech.
Oh, just the content.
Kind of historical.
Things about yourself.
That's all.
Oh, you've done that?
I've already done it.
Oh that'll help me write mine.
Watching Hank and Bob, I realize there are things I won't be able to help my son do.
So I have to show him how to find that help.
But going beyond that typical guy interaction is something we struggle with.
The concept of men not discussing their feelings is all around us, even from an early age, no pun intended.
You know, I think there's something bothering Diego.
Na, I'm sure everything is fine.
You should talk to him.
Guys don't talk to guys about guy problems.
We just punch each other on the shoulders.
That's stupid.
To a girl.
To a guy that's like six months of therapy.
Our childhood seems to have a lot to do with how our relationships unfold.
As I talk more with Hank I found out that the way his journey though male relationships began is actually quite sad, and disturbing.
I was ten years old and my parents wanted to send me to camp.
I had gone to camp since I was seven and they wanted to send me to a new camp.
And they decided to send me to Camp Paradox in the Adirondack Mountains.
And as soon as I got there one of the things that happened at Camp Paradox was that you had rest period after lunch for an hour.
And the first day I was there I was summoned by a counselor.
One of the counselors said,
The head counselor wants to see you.
So we took a walk from our bunk to the head counselors bunk and he said,
The head counselor is waiting for you on the second floor.
And I climbed the second floor and he was there and he was lying in bed and he asked me to lie down next to him, which I did.
And for the next half hour I would be sexually abused.
And when it was over he would tell me to go back to the bunk and not say anything, which I never did, for years.
And that went on for the eight to ten weeks that I was there.
And then the second year when I went back, because I never told anybody what was going on, there was not a safe place in my home and I didn't know what to do with it other than keep it a secret and it happened again.
It's like he was waiting for me to come back.
And I have no idea if he did this to other boys or if I was the only one or whether.
What the situation was, but that's what happened to me.
Hank didn't feel that he could tell anyone, including his father.
So the abuse continued.
As a father, I would want to know even the worst things so I could help.
How can I make sure my son would tell me these things?
I began to wonder if Hank didn't value these friendships because he knows first hand what can happen when men can't talk about difficult, personal things with each other.
I don't have many creative people who I'm close to, but Barry is probably the one
that is the most.
So right now the essence of our relationship is the size of your nose, which is quite distinct.
See the thing is in doing one of these things is that, look at the defining characteristics, and I'm not saying I'm going to be able to capture these defining characteristics, but you have very dramatic features.
I hate my nose Barry.
OK well lets see what we can do about that.
Can you make it smaller?
Sure Hank.
We sat down with each other every month for years and talked with each other about our life journey.
And it's very funny, we frequently do it in a specific restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut and it has paper place mats.
And about twenty minutes into the discussion one of us will go,
Oh I have to write that down.
What you just said about me, I have to write that down, I have to remember that.
And then before the meal is over, which will take three hours of talking about ourselves and questioning each other, all the placemats will be filled and ripped and put in the pocket and everything because the other person has given you insights of things you should think about.
He's not judgmental, he's discerning, very important difference, and he's also compassionate.
He's open to people because he's open to who he is.
I don't think there's too much we don't talk about.
Guys are great, you know, watching football with the beer and,
How you doing?
I'm doing good bro.
But when it comes to saying,
How are you really doing?
Many guys are not good at that and unfortunately we have put that thing on people, of fear a moment a man does that we say,
Oh he's in touch with his feminine side.
And that's ridiculous because actually if only feminine people can vocalize how they're doing, we're in trouble as men.
And I think a lot of the anger, the rage, probably even the physical abuse that happens in families is because of men with bottled up feelings and they haven't been able to express them in a safe environment.
When you look at anyone for any length of time, if you really look at them, you have a relationship with them that you wouldn't have otherwise, that's for sure.
I thought our relationship was pretty awesome before that.
It's really, it's a different dimension actually.
Someone's physicality, there is.
the face is precisely what it is, it's the face.
I think there's a deep sympathy for the currents that run through each of our lives.
And because, the extraordinary thing about a relationship that spans, you know gees.
What's the math on this?
You know, 25 years.
Is that we're not the same people we were 25 years ago.
He's a brilliant architect, he's a brilliant artist, and he's a brilliant musician, he's a kind, kind person.
He understands the importance of communication in art, architecture, business, family and friendship.
And he works hard at it all the time.
And for someone to be committed to that in so many creative environments as he is, it's an amazing experience.
We're still wondering who the hell we are, we're still asking why it is we're doing what we're doing, and those are not insignificant questions and they can be; you can do it as a skipping stone.
But there's a really important dimension I think, in terms of the conversations that we have with each other, as that, there is a demand for sincerity.
I love how you look at me then you go, you smile like,
Ah yes, that's it.
I'm thinking to myself, I'm so sorry Hank, I really am.
I'm doing my best, but this is really.
I hate to be doing this to you.
I hate to really be doing this to you, exactly right.
Nah, times up.
Oh Jesus.
I look like I'm dying.
My former friend Hank.
That was really informative.
Oh, that is funny.
Funny.
Funny, hmmm.
I don't know what ah.
funny, I think it's you know.
We separate all the emotions, attitudes, traits and behaviors into a masculine side and a feminine side.
And what women have said is, you know, you've always said we were nurturing and caring and loving, but you know what, we're also competent, competitive, assertive, aggressive, you know, and so watch us in the work place.
And men have said, well we've always known how to be competent, assertive, aggressive and competitive.
But we haven't known how to be nurturing and caring and loving.
We haven't known how to do that because we suppressed a lot of that.
We want to be a man's man, so we want men's evaluation of us.
So my, my sense is that the next step in some way, of this gender transformation, is for men to look inside and say,
You know what, it is a human quality, not a masculine quality, not a feminine quality, it is a human quality to be nurturing and compassionate and caring.
And since I'm human I can develop those parts of myself as well.
There is a topic that needs to be aired more because people just don't admit it.
Guys don't admit it because they think it's not a guy thing.
It is a guy thing.
It's a really important part of male relationships that is completely undiscovered country, huge, really huge, and that is shopping.
There are a lot of guys out there, you know, I'm kind of out front with this, you know, I just.
I tell people and a lot of people say, you know,
Actually, I love to shop too you know, and I shop with friends of mine.
Now I have guys who call me and say,
Would you like to go shopping?
I'm not kidding and this is something, I'm admitting this, I'm admitting this on camera, I just want to say, I shop.
And I'm proud of it.
When you walk, does your toe kick the end of the shoe?
It is at the end of the shoe but not at the front.
It actually feels pretty good
That's what matters because they will give as you wear.
They will loosen.
Will they?
They will expand?
I'm going to wear them while I'm shopping.
We go to the same store Rags and we meet there monthly.
And it's a little competitive between us of who looks best in what outfit and all those kinds of things.
You have to look at this coat, this coat is beautiful, you have to look at this one, look at this one over here.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes?
See I have the leather but I love the inside, I love the inside.
Barry if you
get this coat I'm going to be jealous, that is beautiful.
Oh my God that is you.
I don't know if I want to admit really how much fun it is to do this, putting on clothes and showing it to one another saying,
God you look, you look fabulous in that, you look really great in that.
Saying, you know,
That is you, that is you.
And the combination of the inside and the outside, I mean it is ridiculous.
Now it occurred to me that if some people saw these guys out and about they might wonder a bit about the nature of their relationship.
And even though Hank and Barry are happily married with kids, the elephant in the room around this whole subject of male relationships.
Not the fear of gay people and not the fear that even your like deep down inside, but rather the fear that other people will see you as gay.
So, this is obviously a sensitive issue and part of an ongoing debate.
Do you know how I know you are gay?
How?
How do you know I'm gay?
Because you macrame-ed yourself a pair of jean shorts.
You know how I know you're gay?
You just told me you're not sleeping with women anymore.
You know how I know that you're gay?
How?
because you're gay and you can tell who other gay people are?
You know how I know you're gay?
How?
You like Coldplay.
So this is what inhibits us from being as expressive or as emotional or as vulnerable and intimate as we would want to be.
That's why I think it's, you know, intimacy is difficult for men.
Because you will bump against this at some point, what do I look like to others?
All of these things swirled in my head as my son lay unaware in his protective cocoon.
Here he is staring at me as if I have all the answers.
But being a man is complicated.
Not all guys want to talk about this stuff.
They'd rather just stay in their protective cocoons.
Incidentally, this is when we find out that is boy was, all boy.
We want to look like we've got it together.
And it takes a humble man to admit that he's weak, that he is struggling, that he doesn't have it all together but, wow, just an incredible gift to be in a relationship where you don't have to pretend.
Omelets.
Let's do some omelets.
OK.
These are great, I love these.
This is an Abigail, I think that's probably a Charlie.
That's my guess, I'm not sure
I think getting to know Hank was kind of a process of growing up for me.
It started when I was over thirty years old and I'm almost forty years old.
I can't do this.
I'm not a baker.
I had a lot of male relationships, I still do and they are very important to me, very critical to me, but he is the only one that I can remember that would have described it as loving relationships.
So cut up some onions, chop them up, we are going to saute some onions.
I'm going to get the eggs.
I'm not used to using these big knives, Charlie.
I have smaller knives.
These are
I have smaller ones don't cut yourself.
These are knives for cutting cows.
I think we will do onions, peppers.
Potatoes and some fresh herbs, maybe I think I have.
Oh, definitely fresh herbs.
When I left Yale I was working at a leather and jewelry store and I was the manager of that store, and Charlie had a used bookstore down the street.
And one day he came in to Old Ways, which was the name of the store, and was looking to buy a hat.
So what was your first impression of me?
Then, I'll tell you what my first impress of you was.
You know, I.
You don't even remember me.
My first impression of you was you had this really attractive girlfriend.
Oh, well I still have a really attractive girlfriend but this one's my wife.
And she wasn't just physically attractive, I mean, she was physically attractive but she was also just really, you know, attractive woman, I really was, I really liked her.
You were impressed she could type fast.
She could type very fast, you're right.
Charlie, you know, is more reserved than I, less expressive, less, maybe, emotionally in touch than I, but he is a generous, generous, generous human being.
You know, he talks a lot about, about all the things we've done over the years and all the things I've done for him over the years, and I have different recollections of it.
I don't remember it as me being so giving and I think he misinterprets, in a way, how incredibly giving he was.
And how I was sort of, all these years learning to be a receptor of that.
There were two events in my world with Charlie that had great meaning for me.
There were two times in my life when I didn't have a place to live.
And Charlie both times said, come live with me.
Now, he had a wife and he had kids, and all that kind of stuff, he didn't have to do that.
He thinks that I was so generous to him at one point and I remember not at all being generous at that point.
I remember being really pissed off at him at that point.
And I think that's because of his nature.
I think that's his.
And I think its what he brought to me over the last thirty years in many ways was this, really teaching how to love people.
So are we, are we two people of equals now?
No, no I think, I think I'm much smarter than you are but I think you're a better focused and better on any given thing you'll do better at it because you'll just do it.
I'm more likely to think about it more and better than you would but not do it as well.
I have to tell you, I disagree.
You don't think I would think about it.
I could never run the mammoth business that you run.
So I feel you've accomplished things I could've never accomplished and on the other hand, you may have better intellectual intelligence than I, but I think I have greater emotional intelligence than you.
Oh, is that's, yes, I think.
So, I think we are both intelligent but in very different ways.
Yes.
But I think on balance I'm a lot smarter than you are.
The thing I find most fascinating about Hank and Charlie is they don't seem to agree on anything, a true odd couple.
That actually appears to bring them together.
It's funny to watch them but it's obvious that, especially in their younger days, conflict has stood in the way of their relationship.
We butted head over business a little bit and that was a mistake that I make, it's a huge, huge mistake that I make and I still make it these days of engaging friends to do work for me and I did that with him.
So he asked me to be part of solving some problems he had at his business and he said he would pay me three thousand dollars for a certain amount of work, so I did the work and sent him the bill and he said he didn't want to pay me.
I've always sort of put one toe in the water.
I wanted him to come over and work for me and then I'd get a bill and I'd go,
Oh, Christ, what am I doing here?
Because that was really my inability to really understand that quality about him, and not just specifically about him but about that concept of people development management.
I think guys are generally not all that good at conflict resolution.
Good at settling it with our fists or good at settling with kind of separation, silence, feuds.
But to sit with a guy who is a buddy and you've had a disagreement and work that out in a spurt of graces is I think one of the most manly things you can do.
For years, we didn't talk to each other.
And then we began to get reconnected.
And I pointed out to him that he was wrong for not paying me for the work he asked me to do.
It's sort of like he won't take no for an answer, he won't take refusal to relate to him for an answer, he wont take, you know, a put down as an answer, he just comes back.
He knows what he cares about, he knows where he is coming from, and it's not like he would equivocate on his, you know, right to be paid for what he was doing, he wouldn't equivocate a minute for that.
You know, and he would stand strong on that.
But whereas I would take it personally, Oh Christ, what am I going to do this guy, you know, he wouldn't take it personally.
He's a stubborn man, when he wants to be, but he's a forgiving man too and he's humble, can admit that he was wrong and he said,
Hank, you're right.
And he gave me a check for three thousand dollars.
You know you always do these wonderful things with other men and it does get me jealous, you know.
Like what?
Like what you were just talking about, like going to Europe with them.
Oh, that wasn't just men though.
I get jealous.
Really?
I do.
I was always jealous of your relationship with Russell too.
I want to tell you 
I'll tell you upstairs later and show you my 
It's a major part of my wardrobe.
I know it is.
If you did, I mean, got any clothes you've ever given me?
My clothes would be so big on you, Charlie.
Russell's bigger than I am, I wear all his, I wear his sport coats.
Well.
You really jealous of that relationship?
I had been.
I'm not so much jealous now but, you know, it gives me twinges of jealousy once in a while.
You have other man friends?
That's what I put, you know.
Somehow when you go on these wonderful
vacations and jaunts without me I feel like I'm not good enough
Huh, very interesting.
I'm not asking you to change your behavior either, I'm just telling you how I feel.
How can you say you're not asking me to change my behavior?
Because you don't need to.
I still love you even if you don't invite me on those events.
I'm going to Paris in March for my birthday.
Well I think male friends for me have been a very important part of a sort of a feedback mechanism, a very important part of my self-image.
They think I'm OK and they think I'm good or they think I'm generous and that's important to me.
This is really good.
This is pretty good.
I like this.
I don't usually do anything this good.
You did well.
They don't usually come out this good.
My prestige in many ways comes from.
has for many years come from male friends who accept and respect me.
One of my favorite poets, William Butler Yeats said, in one of his poem,
He ruffles in a manly pose for all his timid heart.
And I thought that just captures it.
The very verb,
I ruffle
you know, you could almost see, you know ruffling in a manly pose for all his timid heart.
That's what we can't show.
The power of male relationships is if they work, you can show it, you can let down, you can relax, you can exhale, you can say,
You know what?
I don't have everything together and that's OK and I'm still a man despite that.
The two of us are such crazy advocates of the Giants, I mean, we travel all over the country to see the Giants together and he's out in California and I'm in Connecticut so it's a way for us to be together all the time to get to the football games.
To worship the Giants the way we do adds whole new meaning to the whole experience and we, you know, we go overboard, but its fun, it's a great, healthy thing to do.
For the Super Bowl, he sent me these life size figures of the New York Giants to, you know, tape to the walls of the house.
So when he came there we would be surrounded by the images of the New York Giants, that's the kind of thing he does and then we have our Super Bowl parties they are filled with the most outrageous food you should never eat.
We both watch our diets carefully, but when we get together its off.
Whatever you want to do, whatever you want to eat.
And I've, I've tried in the past couple years, you know, we should watch your diabetes and my cholesterol.
No!
We're doing everything that we always do.
We're eating everything in excess.
So, we do.
Its like napoleon's and eclairs and lox bagels and cream cheese and cakes and you name it and we just gorge ourselves on this food and just have the best time in the world rooting for our team and we've been doing that for twenty-seven years.
He fantasized pre-season all the time about how great they are going to be and I'm the pessimist and so we offset each other.
Don't get your expectations too high, Hank.
They are going to be great, super.
I'm not sure, you know, we have these weak spots.
We have to be careful of that, don't just don't set your expectations too high, and he does that so I kind of drag him back down.
We talk pre-game every Sunday, analyze the game, but after Super Bowl, the phone call frequency changes and I think we're both like,
OK, we don't have a reason to talk every single Sunday.
You know, we have our lives and wives and they're football widows for the season and we travel for usually a week and it takes away from your family so you want to sort of balance it out.
All I can say about Scott is, I love him, like a brother, like a father, like a mother, like a son.
And there is no one in the world I feel that way about, other than Scott.
I think that's one of the things you and I have in common, we both came from extremely dysfunctional families.
Really?
Really.
Dysfunctional?
Really?
and June dysfunctional?
Lucille and Henry dysfunctional?
And Richard?
And Todd?
Oh, god.
And so, you and I became family.
The first question that people frequently have about Scott and I is, are we gay.
And we're not.
To people's, I think, disappointment, that two people can love each other as much as we actually love each other, who can have the intimate relationship that we have, who have gone through the kinds of things we both have gone through together.
It just is what it is and it's wonderful for the two of us.
You know one of the things about healthy family is that no matter how far apart you get you still come back to each other.
Right.
And you and I have gone three thousand miles apart.
I know.
And we hurt each other by leaving.
I don't look at it that way though.
I do.
I don-I'm telling you, I never, see, this is what we, we never talked about this.
Scott comes into the house and he says to me,
I'm leaving.
And I said,
But Scott, you jus got here.
And he said,
Oh, no, no I'm leaving Connecticut, I'm moving away from my wife and I'm leaving.
And we had like a two minute discussion and he was out, you know, with me trying to persuade him not to leave, like, there was no discussion here?
You just all of a sudden decide to do this?
I felt he had betrayed me as his best friend at that point and I was deeply, deeply, deeply hurt.
I felt totally rejected by you when you left.
Why?
Because you were like my bro.
Not really, rejected is not the right word.
Yes it was.
That's how I felt.
Don't tell me how, its how I felt.
I felt you were rejecting me for this woman and this, this decision to go out west with her.
Move west.
Move west.
I'm sorry that you felt rejected.
I wasn't, I wasn't rejecting any.
I was in the zone.
I wasn't angry at you, I was just.
Well I'm glad that you weren't.
I was sad that I wasn't going to see you every week.
That I can understand.
We weren't going to probably talk every week.
Well remember at that time we were watching giants games and doing everything every Sunday alternating between homes so I can understand.
Absolutely.
I mean, that was something I dealt with too, but remember, the person that's doing
It, that's a secondary thought.
The person who's leaving has a much easier time than.
Right.
the person.
Exactly.
Who's staying behind, no question.
Exactly.
He's non-confrontational and so it takes him a very long time to process difficult situations and when he.
Even when he figures out what he wants to do or say, he doesn't want to do it because it can be painful and he doesn't want to hurt anybody.
But sometimes, you know, in all of our lives, there are times we need to say something that maybe the other person doesn't want to hear, he doesn't like to do that.
Conflict, was an everyday occurrence in my family and so I don't like it.
Everybody tells me I don't handle it well.
My employees, the people who I work with, my wife, my best friend, my other friends, they tell me this is, this is a shortcoming.
The interesting thing is, he may not want to address that with other people but between he and I, we've never had that hurdle.
If I do something or say something that's inflammatory or disrespectful he will let me know immediately.
Its OK to say things that maybe people aren't happy with but once you get it out there they can process it and move on from it and understand that maybe something needs to change one way or the other and I think that's good for him.
He had just good, natural instincts about how to support people and how to ask good questions to get you to think about your life.
The relationship is always fun, is always filled with humor and is always filled with wisdom and that's why its so valuable.
Very few relationships you have, has that complete package.
We've given each other support, stability, friendship, guidance, and the Giants.
It's been an amazing week.
It's been one of the better weeks I can remember.
It's been one of the worst weeks too.
Well because the giants suck.
The Giants were terrible.
Father, son, brother, friend they call it and I wonder if it wasn't because they felt they were missing those things.
Again, it has become clearer and clearer that men need each other, often times because of what they never had which brought me full circle to the role I will play in my son's life.
If you ask me if father plays an important role in the development of masculinity in the, for young men, there is no question.
Father's central, it's the first person who tells you what it means to be a man.
Many of us grew up with probably emotionally pretty cold relationships between us and our dad.
And I have a pretty good relationship with my dad but it was my mom who taught me how to put my finger on how I was feeling and how to vocalize it.
And unless you've had either an extraordinary dad who has helped you to vocalize that, or otherwise a mom who has helped you, you'll generally be pretty kind of anally retentive in terms of just expressing your emotions.
Very few guys would say as boys that their father is not a real man.
So their father is the first image of what a real man is.
Now, despite the bombardment that you get from the media about what real men are, you know your father's a real man.
I look just like my father; I have my father's name.
He was very gentle, very lovely; he tried to be a good father to me.
The well of emotion that men actually still walk around with about the stuff they didn't say to their father, the stuff they wished they said to their father, they wish they heard from their father, the stuff they wish their father didn't say to them.
I mean, its really quite extraordinary and I've seen men, you know, having a conversation just as we are now and within a
On a dime they'll start to weep.
He was over dominated by all the rest of the family dynamics and he was minimized and so the times we had together were very special, like playing in the park, but it showed me failure, it showed me weakness, it showed me sadness, it showed me the inability to stand up for yourself.
And I remember this one scene when I was saying goodbye to my father one night, he was going to work in the morning, rather he was going to work and I had seen him for breakfast.
And he was walking down the street and he had two big bags and he was 72 years old and he was still working hard, I looked at him with his shoulders, you know, just stooped over and carrying his bags and I said,
I'm never going to end up like that.
I will not let that happen to me.
Its inside here, its my soul, its what I'm made of, I carry my dad with me all the time, I love him.
It's amazing after all this time its so raw still.
I mention that Hank is an old friend, but that's not the whole story.
I first met hank when he hired me to do some video production for the bank where he worked.
He was kind of, a little bit of a fish out of water in this place, even though he was like a senior manager and my business was very creative, it's what I enjoy.
And so he just like got so excited about the opportunity that we were going to have to create something together.
We did very corporate things so it's a different kind of an energy in the corporate world.
Welcome to the effective manager and the engaged employee class.
My name is Hank Mandell executive vice president organizational effectiveness, and I'm pleased you are here today to learn more about the workplace of choice partnership strategy, the employee strategy of the bank.
It was a bank, which is not necessarily like the most creative kind of atmosphere, nothing against bankers.
At the time he was 55 years old and I was 27.
So was actually, you know, twice my age.
But we started to develop this bond this friendship that I honestly didn't think would go a lot further, but it did.
And we got to know each other's families and, as has happened to me in other relationships, we crossed that boundary between work relationships and friendship.
I like to tell people, I have a friend who is 65 years old, one of my closest friends.
I have a friend who's old.
Is that what you're saying?
I use the word ancient but if you, if you want to say old.
No, I do.
I value that.
I have a lot of friends my age, they're great, but it's not like having somebody who's, you know, 30, 28 years older than I am, that's amazing.
You have my back, my best interest, and I think you know I have your back and your best interest.
There is just a deep seeded trust that no matter what happens we are going to certainly take care of each other and I really feel that about you.
One of the most important points over the last ten years for me is making a big career decision.
He wanted to go to California to study film and he didn't think he could afford to do it.
There was a big decision to move my family across the country and to really make huge changes for me and my family.
And in the midst of it I started having incredible fears about it, even though on one hand, it felt like the right thing to do.
On the other hand, I was like, I was just gripped with fear.
He and his wife just happened to be coming over for dinner and I had not shared any of these fears with anybody, and so at that time they came over and we're all just kind of hanging out and they did the whole,
How you doing?
and I said,
Oh, I'm doing fine
and then I was like,
I'm not doing great
and in that moment I made this decision like I looked.
I looked at you and I was like,
I can tell him about this, I can, I can share this without feeling like he's going to judge me, use it against me, whatever the issues of trust might be and I said but I can't imagine taking time off work, I can't imagine, you know, spending the money, I can't justify it, I don't think its going to lead to anything.
All of these fears that I had, and Hank was just like,
That's ridiculous.
You have to do it.
I understood how important it was for you and it was.
You were blocking yourself from taking that step because of money; you were using money as your excuse to deal with your fear.
I've done fundraising for a lot of different events in my life and I said to him and I said, you know, I think we can come up with a way to raise funds for you.
I think there are a lot of people that would like to see you go to Hollywood for a month or two and get more training because people really care about you.
And so he said,
I'm going to help you raise money and I'm going to give you one thousand dollars.
And I was just.
I was shocked.
We put together a fundraising program for him with friends and family and he raised enough money so he could take the trip.
It just encouraged me at a time when I was completely discouraged.
It was because I shared my life with him, because I was willing to say to him,
Here's what's going on with me.
I trusted him enough
I think it changed his life because he eventually moved out to Los Angeles.
If it wasn't for him, I don't think I would have done that and I think its one of the most important moments of the last ten years.
I can't remember a time when someone other than my own family believed in me enough to help me like this and looking back now years later, money was helpful, but not what I really needed.
I needed someone I could talk to, someone who believed in me, someone who would help me take this huge step.
What I needed was a friend.
I guess I've just never put it this way but it seems as though our lives are defined, more than anything else, by relationships.
And not just the ones we have, but often the ones we don't.
I find it's difficult to define depth or meaning or intimacy between men, but at this point I have to acknowledge that it's important.
There appears to be something we need in these relationships that we just can't get anywhere else.
Only men know what a man feels, experiences, loves, and fears.
The last thing I want people to think is that you have to be damaged in some way in order to want male relationships.
It just so happens that I was damaged and looking for these relationships but you can be very healthy, and a lot of the men that I have relationships with are very healthy and never have been sexually abused and they're in search for the same thing I'm in search with, which is strong, intimate relationships.
I think that somehow, you know, we're afraid that if we actually showed who we really were, that no one would like us, that we're afraid that its really ugly in there.
And I think if we really construct an idea of masculinity is about bravery and all that, this is the thing we have to be bravest about.
We have to be brave enough to show ourselves.
Hank's life has been primarily influenced by the men he has known.
Although disappointed and even abused by his role models, he ultimately found some redemption in the men he was able to help, and the men who helped him.
We all start out with a clean slate, which is then colored by relationships for better or for worse, beginning with our parents and family, then on to mentors and friends.
The experts, and even my own experience tells me our relationship is the most important one you will have.
I'll teach him many things, some helpful and some not.
I now realize a deep relationship comes at a price.
I have to be willing to reveal myself to him to share my dreams, but also my fears.
The best way to show him how this works is to let him see who I really am.

I agree that they'll try to use the park eventually, but don't you think the city government will protect it?
Really?
When is the last time a politician protected something beautiful in this town?
Well you have a point there.
We need to protect our parks for our kids in the future.
If we keep building shops everywhere, there'll be no place to get back to nature.
I couldn't agree with you more.
I usually don't get involved in politics.
Neither do I.
but maybe I will this time.
Do you think that will help?
It can't hurt.
It's time someone started to speak out about all the commercial development.
Enough is enough!
Ain't that the truth!
What a tasteless sandwich!
What a waste of time!
What a crappy day!
The test was so difficult.
He drives so slowly.
He's so incompetent.
I've got so much work to do this week!
There are so many children in this room.
I can't hear myself think.
She was such a bad teacher that I couldn't learn a thing.
It was such bad weather that we had to cancel the trip.
She was late to the party because she had such a demanding boss.
Those people are too loud.
I can't concentrate.
This fan is too noisy.
I'd like to return it.
She drives too fast for me.
There are too many questions left for us to move ahead with the project.
There is too much pollution in this city.
It stinks!
Anna has too much time on her hands.
I dislike having to wait so long to get help.
I loathe red tape.
I find her very annoying.
We find these exercises bothersome.
I find your complaints ridiculous!
I'm sorry you feel that way.
I'm sorry you've been having such a hard time lately.
I'm sorry the price is so high.
I apologize for the lack of attention.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
Hello, can you help me?
Sure, what may I help you with?
I'd like to return this radio.
Certainly, would you mind telling me why?
It's too difficult to use.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are so many options that I can't use it!
Perhaps we can find a radio that's a little less complicated.
I really dislike complicated gadgets.
I hear you!
Let's first return this and then we can look for a new one.
Thanks for your help.
I didn't want to complain.
No problem.
I'm sick and tired of work!
Everybody says that.
Yes, but I mean it!
I hate my boss!
Why what has he done now?
He's such a jerk.
He's so stressful.
It can't be that bad.
Oh he is, believe me.
Yesterday, he was so insulting that two colleagues quit.
Really?
Yes, they said he didn't pay enough for them to put up with his demands.
That's serious.
Maybe you should look for a new job.
Maybe I should.
I can't stand him.
Let me make you a gin and tonic.
That sounds good to me.
You should continue to study English, so you can travel the world.
You ought to visit your friends.
I'm sure you'll have a great time.
I really appreciate your ability to teach beginning level students.
I enjoy your singing so much.
That is such a beautiful painting!
That is such a lush garden.
You have such an cozy home.
You have such wonderful taste in decoration.
This lasagna is so tasty!
Those boys are so well-behaved.
I know how difficult this situation is for you.
I understand with how hard you work.
I empathize with how complicated your life is at the moment.
I understand how long it took to get your degree.
Maybe I can arrange an interview for you with a friend who works at Johnson and Sons.
I got an A on my finals last week!
That's so amazing!
I know.
I studied a lot, but it was worth it.
You're such a good student.
I never doubted you could do it.
Thanks, I appreciate your support.
Hey, you're there for me when I need it.
That's because your such a good friend.
Dude, don't exaggerate!
No, really.
You ought to make more friends.
People love compliments.
I guess that's true.
Anyway, thanks for your encouragement.
No problem.
What's going on?
Nothing much.
Come on.
How did the game go?
We won.
I even scored a goal.
There you go!
You're such a good soccer player.
You should always score a goal.
It's just a game.
Yeah but 
I'm proud of you.
I know how hard your work at the game.
Coach Peters is a great coach, that's all.
No, no.
Don't be modest.
You're great!
Thanks Dad.
Hey, can I have twenty bucks?
Ah, there's the son I know and love.
Sure, why not?
You deserve it.
Anything for my boy.
I am very excited about working with Tom on the new project.
I am quite excited about my new car!
I am really looking forward to opening the new store next week.
She's looking forward to taking some time off work.
I feel confident that I'll get the position.
We feel confident that our son will succeed.
I cherish the time I spend with you.
Jack cherishes every opportunity to speak to a client.

I can't believe we're going to have another baby!

Do you know the sex?
No, we want it to be a surprise.
Really, I would want to know so I could buy all the right stuff.
You have a point.
Maybe we should find out.
In any case, I am really, really happy for your two.
Thanks.
I just had to share the good news.
Let's go get a beer to celebrate!
That's a good idea!

I thought you might say that.
I'll speak to him.
Yes, that would be best for that type of information.
Thank you for helping out.

That is not fair
I am sorry to hear that.
That is too bad.
What can I do to help?
Is there anything I can do for you?
Would you like to talk about it?
What is the matter?
You seem sad.
Tell me all about it.
Why the long face?
I am feeling out of sorts today.
I am sorry to hear that.
What seems to be the problem?
I am really upset about the changes at work.
I know it's been difficult for everyone.
I just don't understand why they had to change our team!
Sometimes management does things we don't understand.
It make no sense!
I just don't feel well.
Maybe you need some time off work.
Yes, maybe that's it.
Is there anything I can do to help?
No, just talking about it makes things better.

Bummer.
What seems to be the problem
I don't think he loves me anymore.
Really!
Are you sure about that?
Yes, I saw him yesterday with her.
They were laughing and having a great time.
Maybe they were just studying together.
It doesn't mean he's leaving you.
That's what I keep telling myself.
Still, I am feeling blue.
Is there anything I can do?
Yes, let's go shopping!
Now you are talking.
A nice new pair shoes would help you feel much better.

If you put it that way, I am sure I can figure something out.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Can I go out tonight?
It's a school night!
I am afraid that's not possible.
All my friends are going to the game!

Don't worry about it.
Could I ask you a question?
Sure, what do you need?
Would it be too much trouble for you to let me come in at 10 tomorrow morning?
Oh, that's a little difficult.
Yes, I know it's last moment, but I have to go to the dentist.
I am afraid I can't let you come in late tomorrow.
We really need you at the meeting.
OK, I just thought I would ask.
I'll get a different appointment.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Would you mind letting me watch my show?
Sorry, but I can't do that.
Why not?

But I am going to miss my favorite game show!
Watch it online.
Don't bother me.
Could you please watch your show online, it's a rerun!
Sorry, but I am unable to do that.

We've been waiting for more than 30 minutes!
Are you sure you read the directions correctly?
Do you think I made a mistake?!
I am sure he said Joe's Bar and Grill.
I wish you had brought the directions with you.
Well if you hadn't lost them, I would have brought them!
Now, now, let's not get into that.
I told you I put them on the shelf in the hall.
It is no use worrying about that now.
Anyway, what will we be doing this time tomorrow?
I am so excited about getting away on holiday.
So am I.
Just think, this time tomorrow we'll be lying on the beach soaking up the sun.
No, I'll be sitting at the bar enjoying my Gin and Tonic and reading a good book.
It is going to be wonderful, isn't it?
It is been so long since we last got away.
Yes I wish he were here.
I am getting hungry!
Why don't you ask that man for help.
Excuse me, we've been waiting for over a half an hour for a friend.
Have you seen anyone looking for somebody?
No, I am afraid I haven't.
I just don't understand our friend is never late.
Maybe he is at Joe's Pub.
Yes, there is also a Joe's Pub in town.
People mix us up all the time!
Do you think you could give them a ring and see if he is there?
Certainly, no problem.
What is his name?
He is there, isn't he?
Yes, he is there and he is been waiting for half an hour.
Oh, no!
He is at Joe's Pub!
Is there a taxi nearby?
Yes, on the corner opposite the church.
Let's go!
I wish you had brought those directions!
What can I do for you today?
This is quite lovely.
Where was it made?
Oh, I see you have excellent taste.
Yes, that is beautiful, isn't it?
It is local pottery.
I think it was painted here by a local artist.
It is really something
Do you have anything else by this artist?
I am not really sure who exactly painted which pieces of pottery, but here are some similar pieces.
No, they're really not the same.
How about these here?
I had them brought in just this morning.
Yes, those are quite nice.
What about the prices?
Obviously, it depends on what you would like to buy.
That plate that you were first looking at costs fifty dollars.
That is quite expensive.
I can't afford that.
Remember these are hand painted pieces of pottery, that kind of handicraft work doesn't come cheaply.
Yes, I understand that.
But I really think that fifty dollars is just too much.
Listen, I can see that you are in love with that plate.
Let's just make it forty five dollars.
I'd really like you to take that home with you.
How about thirty five dollars.
I really can't go any higher than that.
I really can't, I mean that would be selling at cost.
Thirty eight is absolutely the most I can spend.
All right.
I really shouldn't.
The artist is going to have me put out of business for selling his wares at such low prices.
Come, come.
Let's not exaggerate.
You're a clever one, aren't you?
I am just someone who pays close attention to what I spend.
There's no shame in that.
Here you are.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, have a pleasant day.
I have to admit you have a beautiful backyard.
How do you do it?
Well it does take time and patience.
But I've also got a few secrets.
What do I have to do to get you to reveal your secrets?
You know if I had the money, I'd just hire a gardener.
No, no you needn't do that.
I'd never hire a gardener.
Working in the yard is the greatest form of relaxation that I know of!
You're kidding, right?
I would never have planted so many trees if I had known how much work they'd require.
You see, that's your problem.
Right there.
Your attitude is all wrong.
Excuse me.
My attitude is wrong?
What does attitude have to do with gardening?
You've got to love working in the backyard
that's my secret!
What kind of secret is that?
I expected some special lawnmower, or a special type of gardening tool.
No, any lawnmower or tool will do the job.
It is all in the mind.
I can't believe what you're saying.
Let me see if I understand
It's very simple
If I had a better feeling about my work in the garden, everything would be wonderful.
I'd have a beautiful lawn like you, I'd have healthy plants like you.
Yes that's it.
You've got it!
all just a simple matter of enjoying myself.
Now you understand.
Look, can I borrow the tea you are drinking?
Because, to tell you the truth, I think you're crazy!
We live in modern times, but the old farmers what you put into the land you reap.
On second thought, I think I'll just pay a gardener.
Ha ha, that won't work.
Why not?
Because he has to enjoy his gardening

Yes, I like that place.
How do you like the food?
It tastes really great.
Did you cook it?
Yes.
I made it this afternoon.
Would you like some more?
OK, just a little though.
I'm really full.
Oh.
Would you like some soup instead?
What kind is it?
Tomato and rice.
Have you had that before?
No.
This is my first time.
How does it taste?
It's good, try it.
What do you think?
Wow.
It is good.
Did you make that also?
Yes.
You're a really good cook.
Thanks, next time I'll make chicken soup for us.
That sounds good.
Did you study cooking in school?
No, I learned by myself.
I have a good cook book that I read when I have time.
Will you help me take these things to the car?
OK, which car do you want me to put them in?
Bring them to my wife's car.
Which one is hers?
The blue SUV in front of the Honda.
What should I take first?
That chair over there, but please be careful with it.
It was a gift from my mother-in-law.
Don't worry, I won't drop it.
Wow, it's really heavy.
I don't think I can move it by myself.
Let me help you with that.
I don't want you to hurt your back.
Where are you taking all this stuff?
Didn't I tell you?
We're moving to Florida?
You're moving now?
I knew you were moving, but I thought you said you were moving next month.
Yes, that's true, but my wife found a new apartment on the Internet the other day and she wants to move right away.
Your husband has a really nice car.
Thanks.
It's a lot better than mine, and it's new.
Where are you going?
We're going to visit my sister in the city.
I didn't know your sister lives in the city, when did she move there?
About a year ago.
She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, across from the public library.
I see.
It's almost 5:00 pm now, don't you think there will be a lot of traffic?
Oh, we're not driving.
We're going to take the subway.
The subway only takes about 20 minutes.
Yes, but it can be very crowded around this time.
I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.
I take the subway to work everyday, so I'm used to it now.
Doesn't your mother live in the city?
Yes, she's lived there for about ten years.
I remember when she moved there.
Apartments were a lot cheaper then.
I know what you mean.
It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now.
Have a good time.
Next time you're free, give me a call and we'll go play poker.
See you later.
I heard you took a trip to San Diego.
Is that right?
I just got back this morning.
That sounds really nice.
What did you do there?
Well we were only there for three days, so 
We didn't do too much.
We went shopping and went out to dinner a few times.
At night we walked around the city with some friends.
Did you take any pictures?
Yes, I have them with me.
Do you want to look at them?
Sure, I love looking at photos.
This one is of my wife and me on the beach, and this one is our daughter Emily standing next to my wife.
Your daughter looks like her mother.
I know, they look very similar.
Where was this picture taken?
That was taken at the train station before we left.
Did you have time to go to the zoo?
No, not this time.
We went there last time.
It looks like you all had a nice time.
It was a lot of fun.
Good afternoon, how may I help you?
Hi, I'd like to order some flowers.
Who are they for?
They're for my wife.
Her name is
What kind of flowers would you like?
I don't know.
I don't know too much about flowers.
Can you recommend something?
OK.
What's the reason you are sending her flowers?
Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers.
Do you know what kind of flowers she likes?
I'm not sure.
I know I should know that, but I can't remember right now.
They're for your wife, so I think you should give her roses.
Roses will be fine.
What color?
I think red would be nice.
Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them?
Can you deliver them please.
What's the address?
Sorry, I think you have the wrong number.
Yes.
Who are you looking for again?
Oh, I thought you said
Sorry about that.
This is the right number, but she's not here right now.
Do you know where she went?
She went to the store to buy some groceries.
Would you like to leave a message?
Yes, would you please tell her I called?
I met you a couple months ago at the Christmas party.
Oh, yes.
How are you?
Good.
She will be back in about 20 minutes.
I'll tell her you called.
OK.
Thanks.
Bye bye.
Hello?
How's the weather there today?
It's really cold.
It snowed all day and the schools closed early.
What's the temperature?
It's 30 degrees now.
It was even colder this morning.
Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow?
I was watching the news a little earlier.
They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow.
I really don't like the winter.
I wish it were summer.
Me too.
How's the weather where you are?
It's not too bad, but it's pretty cold here too.
It was about 45 today and it rained this afternoon.
I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow.
It's almost Christmas.
What are you doing this weekend?
Nothing special, just working.
Why do you ask?
I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping.
Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend?
I'd like to, but I'm not sure if I can.
Work has been really busy lately.
Why don't we go on Friday instead?
Friday's not good.
I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work.
OK, then let's try to go this weekend.
I should know if I can go by Friday.
Is it OK if I call you then?
That's fine.
What's your number?
Let me give you my email address too.
OK, I'll talk to you soon.
Are you there yet?
I just got off the subway.
I'm almost there.
Sorry I'm late.
That's no problem.
I just wanted to tell you I'm inside.
Where are you?
On the second floor.
Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor?
Come upstairs.
What?
Oh, Can you hear me OK?
I said, come to the second floor.
Oh, OK.
What are you doing there?
Just looking at some books on how to learn English.
Do you want to get something to eat later?
No, I'm still full from dinner.
What do you want to do?
I don't know for sure.
When you get here we'll talk about it.
OK, see you soon.
Bye.
What do you do for work?
I'm still a student.
What school do you go to?
Boston University.
That's a good school.
What do you study?
I'm studying English, math, and history.
My major is English.
How long have you been studying English?
More than six years.
That's a long time.
I started to learn English when I was in high school.
No wonder your English is so good.
Actually, it's not that good.
I can read but I can't speak very well.
I haven't had a lot of chance to practice.
I see.
Talking with other people is very important.
Yes, but I still don't have many friends here yet.
I'm having a party tonight at my apartment.
You should come.
Oh thanks for inviting me.
I'd love to come.
It's good to see you again.
How have you been?
OK, I didn't sleep much last night though.
I stayed up until 2AM studying for an exam.
I was up late last night too.
The semester is almost over.
I've had exams all week.
Are you going back to California after you graduate?
I think so.
After I graduate I'll probably go back home and try to get a job.
Do you know where you'd like to work?
Not yet, but I want to be an English translator.
That'd be really cool.
I'd like to be a translator too, but I don't think my English is good enough.
Don't worry about that.
Your English is better than most of my classmates.
Thanks.
Where are you going now?
I'm going to study at the library.
I have to take an exam tomorrow.
Me too.
How late does the library stay open?
I think it's open until 11:30pm.
OK, Good luck.
You too.
How are you?
Good.
I called you yesterday.
Did you get my message?
Yes, I was taking a shower when you called.
I saw that you called and I tried to call you back, but I think your phone was off.
No problem.
I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week.
You're still coming to the wedding with me, right?
Oh, is that next week?
Yes.
Did you forget?
No, of course not.
I already bought them a present.
That's good.
I want to invite her also.
Next time you see her, can you tell her for me.
Sure.
Does she know your friend?
Yes, I think they might have gone to the same college or something like that.
I'm not exactly sure how they know each other.
Are we all going to drive together?
Yes.
I'll pick you up first, and then we'll go get her.
Hi, I'd like to see the doctor.
Do you have an appointment?
When would you like an appointment?
Is today possible?
Yes.
Today is fine.
What time would you like?
As soon as possible.
My stomach really hurts.
Please wait a moment.
I'll see if the doctor is available.
Sorry, he's with a patient right now.
It's probably going to be about another 30 minutes.
Would you mind waiting a little longer?
No problem.
May I see your insurance card please.
Here you are.
Thanks.
That's going to be 25 dollars for today's visit.
Really?
I didn't think it would be that much.
I know how you feel.
I'll pay with cash.
Thank you.
Would you please turn on the heat?
It's really cold in here.
Did you get the mail yet?
Yes.
I picked it up this morning.
There were a few bills and a letter from my mother.
There was also a lot of junk mail.
Was there anything for me?
I don't remember, let me check.
Yes, it looks like there's something here for you.
Who's it from?
The American Embassy.
My hands are dirty.
Will you open it for me?
Sure.
What does it say?
It says your passport is ready.
You can pick it up anytime.
Do you think you can drive me there?
Sure, when?
I think we should go get it now.
I'm going to wash my hands and then we'll go.
Is that OK?
That's fine.
How are you feeling?
I still have a cold.
Still?
It's been over a week now, hasn't it?
It's been a while.
I started feeling this way last Monday.
Are you feeling any better?
A little.
I took some medicine this morning and I feel a little better now.
What's wrong?
I have a bad cough.
Did you go see the doctor yet?
Not yet, I might go tomorrow.
I'm going to the drug store now, can I get you anything?
Yes, if it's not too much trouble, would you get me some tissues.
Sure.
Anything else?
No, that's it.
OK, I'll be back in about an hour.
If you think of anything else you need, give me a call.
Thanks.
It's good to see you again.
Are you here for work?
Is he with you?
No I'm here alone.
He couldn't come this time.
How long will you be staying?
4 days.
I'm going back on Friday.
My brother and I are getting together for dinner.
Do you want to come with us?
That would be nice.
I have a meeting in an hour.
I can meet you afterwards, if that's OK.
The meeting shouldn't last long.
That's fine.
Who is your meeting with?
The Boston Insurance Company.
I'll call you when it's over.
OK.
Can I use your phone?
I left mine in the car and I want to call them to get directions.
Sure, here you go.
Hello?
What's up?
Not much.
Where are you?
I'm in the car driving home.
When you get home will you send me an email with directions to the party tonight?
Sure, no problem.
When do you think you'll get home?
I don't know, maybe in about 30 minutes or so.
There's a lot of traffic.
I have to go out soon.
Can you just send me a text message with the address instead.
OK, I'll do that as soon as I get home.
Thanks a lot.
Drive carefully.
OK, I'll see you tonight.
It's me again.
What time do you think you'll get to the party tonight?
Sorry, what did you say?
Hello, can you hear me?
I said what time do you think you'll be getting to the party?
Sorry, I can't hear you.
Can you hear me now?
No, not very clearly.
It's really noisy here.
It might be my cell phone, I don't think I have very good reception.
Oh, that's OK.
Can I call you right back?
OK.
What should we do today?
I have been studying all week.
I'd like to exercise.
Me too.
Let's go to the gym.
Good idea.
What are we going to do there?
We can lift weights or play basketball.
I like to play basketball.
Are you good at it?
Not really, but I like to play.
I use to play a lot when I was in school, but now there's no time.
I know what you mean.
I use to play soccer a lot.
Do you think we can play soccer there?
No, there's not enough room.
I think it's better if we play outside.
OK, maybe we can go play soccer later this afternoon.
It's too cold outside today.
Let's wait until the weather gets a little warmer.
OK.
Are you OK?
I'm OK now, but I got into an car accident this morning.
Were you hurt?
No, but my neck is still a little sore.
What happened?
I wasn't paying attention and I hit a car that stopped in front of me.
Were the people in the other car all right?
Yes, they're fine.
I wasn't going very fast.
Were you wearing a seatbelt?
Yes.
Did the police come?
I called them on my cell phone right after it happened.
Do you want me to drive you home?
No, I need to go get my car fixed this afternoon.
How are you feeling?
I don't feel good.
What's bothering you?
I have a stomachache and a headache.
Where does it hurt?
Here.
Do you have a fever?
No, I don't think so.
OK.
Let me look at your throat.
Open your mouth.
Your throat's red.
Does it hurt?
Yes.
It's sore.
When did it start to feel this way?
Last week.
I think you have a virus.
It might be the flu.
I'm going to give you a prescription for some medicine.
Thank you.
Try to get some rest, and be sure to drink lots of water and orange juice.
How may I help you?
Hi.
I'd like to make a reservation.
Just a moment.
OK, for what date?
How many nights will you be staying?
What's the room rate?
75 dollars a night plus tax.
Would you like me to reserve a room for you?
Yes please.
Your name?
OK, You're all set.
We'll see you on the 25th.
What would you like to do?
I don't know.
Maybe watch TV.
That's a good idea.
We're going shopping later so I think you should rest for a while.
I don't think I want to go anymore.
What do you mean?
I thought you said we were going shopping.
I know, but I changed my mind.
I'm too tired.
I still have a lot of stuff to buy.
When do you think we'll go?
Maybe tonight.
OK, would you mind if I use your phone?
Sorry I don't have signal.
Are you kidding?
I usually have really good reception here.
My phone is very old and it doesn't work very well.
What if I take it outside?
Yes, that's fine.
It works well outside.
Would you like to play a game?
OK, what kind of game?
Lets play cards?
Do you know how to play Blackjack?
Yes, that's an easy game.
I don't want to play that right now.
OK, Do you remember how to play poker?
I think so, but you're going to have to explain the rules to me again.
OK.
Look at this piece of paper.
It has all the rules on it.
OK, yes.
I remember now.
I think the last time we played this game, you won and I lost.
Yes, that was fun.
OK, let's play, but this time I don't want to bet money.
OK, we won't bet.
We'll just play for fun.
Come in.
Happy Birthday!
Thanks.
I can't believe you remembered that.
I have a calendar in my computer.
It helps me remember things like that.
What are you up to?
I'm reading a book my cousin gave me for my birthday.
Let me see.
Oh, I have this book at home.
I want to give you a present too.
Wow, it's a guitar.
I already have one, but I like this one better.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Do you know how to play the guitar?
I know how to play.
My father taught me when I was young.
Will you play it now?
I want to listen to some music.
OK.
Do you know this one?
I've heard that one.
I could sing that song when I was in middle school.
It's an old one.
It makes me feel old.
When I was in college they use to play it on the radio all the time.
Good evening.
Hi.
Do you have any vacancies tonight?
Yes.
The rate is 55 dollars.
Do the rooms have internet access?
We have wireless.
If you have a computer you can use the wireless network for an additional 5 dollars.

Would you like a smoking or a non-smoking room?
Non-smoking.

Visa.
Here you are.
How many people?
Two.
Would you like a king size bed or two double beds?
King size please.
You're in room 237.
It's on the second floor.
Here's your key.
Sign here please.
What time is checkout?
Hello, how may I help you?
I'd like to send this package to California.
Would you like to send it overnight or by regular mail?
How much is it to send it overnight?
20 dollars
And by regular mail?
12 dollars.
I'd like it to get there tomorrow.
Please fill out this form.
When you're finished, come back to this window.
OK, I think I'm done, is this correct?
Yes, that's right.
I'd also like to mail this letter.
Do you need to buy stamps?
Yes.
A book of stamps costs 3 dollars.
So that'll be 23 dollars for everything.
Oh, I forgot my wallet in the car.
I'll be right back.
Why didn't you call me last night?
I was worried about you.
Sorry, I was sick.
I went to bed early.
What's wrong?
I had a cough and my eyes were really dry.
Are you better now?
Yes, I'm feeling a lot better.
Much better than yesterday.
Do you have allergies?
Yes.
Last time I went to the doctor, he did some tests and told me I have allergies.
It gets worse in the spring.
What time did you wake up this morning?
Around 9:30AM.
Are you going to work today?
No.
I think I'll just stay home and watch TV.
I can work from home today.
Good.
Get some rest and I'll bring over some food later.
Thanks.
It's been a long time.
Where are you working now?
I work at a software company downtown.
I'm an engineer.
That's interesting.
What kind of software do you write?
It's a database for small businesses.
Does your company have a website?
Yes.
What's the website address?
How can I get the software?
You can download it from the website.
It's very popular and it's free.
OK, I'll do that.
I have to go now.
It was really nice seeing you again.
It was nice seeing you too.
Email me next week and we'll get together for coffee.
My computer is broken so I can't send email right now.
Can I call you?
What are you listening to?
I'm listening to the radio.
I know that.
Who are they playing?
Guess.
I think that's the Beatles, right?
That's right.
How did you know that?
In my country everyone knows who they are.
They're famous.
Really?
Of course.
My parents saw them at a concert a long time ago.
Did you know that they're from England?
Yes, of course.
What kind of music do you usually listen to?
I listen to everything, but my favorite is Pop.
I see.
Who's your favorite singer?
I like her too.
She's got a great voice.
Do you need a taxi?
Yes.
Do you have any luggage?
Just these two suitcases.
OK, I'll put them in the back for you.
Where are you going?
The Comfort Inn.
I think there are two in Boston.
Which one are you going to?
The one downtown.
Is this your first time in Boston?
No.
I've been here many times.
I come here for work all the time.
Do you know how long it'll take?
It shouldn't take long.
Probably about 15 minutes.
Wow, it looks like the traffic is really bad.
There might be an accident up ahead.
OK, then stop at the next intersection.
I'm gonna get out there and take the subway.
Are you hungry?
No, why?
We've been driving for a long time.
I think we'd better find some place to eat soon.
No, I'm OK.
We're late so we'd better not stop.
We've passed that same store three times already.
I think we're lost.
We should ask someone for directions.
We're not lost.
I've never gone this way before.
Do you know where you're going?
Yes, this road goes through town.
It's faster than the highway.
OK.
Would you mind driving a little slower please?
Sure, no problem.
Did you see that sign back there?
I think this is a one way street.
No, I didn't see it.
I'm going to have to turn around.
You can't turn around here.
I think you should let me drive.
I think you're right.
I'm getting tired.
Can you do me a favor?
Sure.
I can't find my purse.
Can you help me?
No problem, I'll help you look for it.
Thanks.
What color is it?
It's black.
Did you look in the kitchen?
Yes, I already looked there.
I'll look in the living room.
Did you find it?
No.
It's not in there.
When was the last time you saw it?
I had it when I went to the library this morning.
Do you think you might have left it there?
Maybe.
I'll call the library and ask them if anyone found it.
Wait!
Is this it?
Yes, That's it.
That's my purse.
Thanks for helping me find it.
Excuse me, sir, will you take a picture of us?
Sure.
This is a really nice camera.
Thanks, my parents gave it to me.
How do you use it?
You press this button here.
Come a little closer.
Wait, that's too close.
Move a little to the left.
Move back a little farther.
OK, stay right there.
Do you mean here?
Yes, that's good.
Oh, I can't get it to work.
You need to hold down the button for about 3 seconds.
OK I got it, are you ready?
Yes.
Smile.
What's going on?
I'm waiting in line to buy a DVD player.
The line is too long.
Why don't you come back tomorrow.
I think you're right.
They're going to close soon.
Let's go get some coffee.
OK.
Wait a minute, I have to get something out of my purse.
Will you hold this for me?
Sure.
Oops.
What happened?
I dropped your calculator.
Is it broken?
I'm not sure.
Let me have a look.
No, I don't think it's broken.
The button came off though.
I can fix it.
Sorry about that.
Don't worry about it.
I do that all the time.
If it is broken, I have another one in my car.
Hey, how did you get here?
I rode my bike.
Are you serious?
Why did you do that?
I could have picked you up.
That's OK, I didn't want to bother you.
I know you don't like to wake up early.
That's so nice of you.
Aren't you cold?
No, not really.
I wore a coat.
What's in the bag?
It's a special type of apple.
Oh.
Can I try one?
It's very sweet.
I put sugar on it.
These apples are really good.
They were only 30 cents each.
Aren't those more expensive than the ones at the supermarket?
They're more expensive, but they taste better.
Did you buy any other fruit?
besides the apples, I bought oranges and bananas.
Hello?
Hi.
Are you still up?
Yes.
You sound tired, is everything OK?
Everything's fine.
I'm just getting ready to go to bed.
It's been a really long day.
Do you have time to get some coffee with me later?
I have something I want to talk to you about.
No, sorry.
Not today.
I have to get up early tomorrow.
Oh, What are you going to do tomorrow?
My mother-in-law is coming over so I have to get up early and clean the house.
I see.
Are you free tomorrow?
Yes, in the afternoon.
I have to finish something I'm working on, but I'll be free after 3:30.
Do you want to get together after you finish work?
Do you think you'll have time?
My mother-in-law will be leaving here around 2pm.
I just talked to him.
What did he say?
He said he had to cancel the meeting this afternoon.
Oh, I see.
Is there a problem?
No, It's not a big deal.
He and I were suppos
to talk to some new customers today.
Sorry to hear that.
It's OK.
This has been happening quite a bit recently.
That's strange.
I wonder why?
His wife has been sick, so sometimes he has to go home early to take care of her.
I see.
How's work been going?
Things are slow right now.
Would you mind if I borrow your phone, mine's out of batteries and I have to call my boss to tell him about this.
OK, let me go get it.
Its in the car.
Sorry for calling so late, I hope I didn't wake you up.
Actually, I was just finishing some work.
I haven't gone to bed yet.
Did you hear that he got fired yesterday?
No.
I didn't hear that.
Are you sure?
She told me this afternoon.
She was pretty upset about it.
That's too bad.
He is a nice guy.
I know.
Why did they fire him?
She didn't say.
I see.
If you talk to her again, tell her there's a job opening at my company.
She can have an interview this week if he wants.
Oh, thank you so much.
I'll call her and tell her.
You look upset, what's wrong?
It's nothing.
I'm just a little nervous.
Is everything all right?
I'm having surgery tomorrow on my finger.
What's wrong with your finger?
I broke it the other day playing basketball.
Oh, that's terrible.
It's been bothering me since that day.
Are you afraid of having surgery?
Yes.
I've never had surgery before.
I wouldn't worry.
I had to have surgery on my leg last year.
Everything went fine.
Were you nervous before the surgery?
A little.
Who's your doctor?
Oh, I've heard he's really good.
I don't think you have anything to worry about.
Good.
That makes me feel much better.
Are you and him still dating?
Things are going really good.
Where did you meet him?
I met him at the library a couple of weeks ago.
We were sitting at the same table and he asked to borrow my pen.
Wow, that's a nice story.
I was telling him about it the other day.
He thought it was pretty romantic.
Do you two have plans for tonight?
Yes, I think we're going to rent a movie.
Have you seen anything good lately?
I saw it the other day.
I've heard that's a really funny movie.
Are you kidding?
That movie's not funny.
It's sad.
I was crying at the end.
You're really sensitive, aren't you?
I guess so.
Maybe that's why I can't find a girlfriend.
Can I talk to you for a moment.
I just heard the cookie factory downtown is going out of business.
Where did you hear that?
He told me.
I'm not sure that's true.
I haven't heard anything about it.
She said that they have already started to lay people off.
Doesn't your father work there?
Yes, I'm really worried he might get laid off, he just started to work there about three months ago.
What do you think I should do?
I'd talk to your father.
Yeah, but
If there was something wrong I don't think he'd tell me.
He doesn't like to upset me, but I really would like to know what's going on.
So what are you gonna do?
Aren't you good friends with the president of that company?
Yes, we use to work together at a different company about five years ago.
Maybe you could call him and see what's going on.
Well I don't know.
I guess I could.
It's pretty late now, but I'll call him in the morning.
OK, thanks so much.
Wow, I'm really getting fat.
You don't look fat.
Yes, but I am.
I've gained 10 pounds in the last two months.
Look at my stomach.
How much do you weigh?
I think about 170 pounds.
What kind of foods do you eat?
I usually have pasta for dinner.
Sometimes I get take-out or fast food if I don't have enough time to cook.
I was reading a diet book the other day.
It said that if you eat meat and nothing else, you'll lose weight quickly.
Wow, does that work?
I don't know, but someone told me they tried it and lost 20 pounds.
That sounds good, but I'm not sure how long I could do that.
I know, once you start eating vegetables and bread again you'll probably start gaining weight.
I think I'm going to try it anyway.
Who's the author?
I can't remember.
It's not that popular anymore.
When I get home I'll check and give you a call.
I can't talk now.
Can I call you back later?
Sure.
Is there a problem?
I'm late for work and my car isn't working, so I need to find someone to take me to work.
I can take you.
Oh, really?
Thank you.
That would help a lot.
Do you need me to pick you up after work also?
Yes, if it's not too much trouble.
It's no problem.
I'm leaving my house now.
I'll be right there.
OK.
I'll wait for you in front of my apartment building.
Do you know what's wrong with your car?
I'm not exactly sure.
I think there's a problem with the engine.
OK, I'll have a look when I get there.
I know a lot about cars.
When I was younger my father and I use to fix old cars.
Hey, what have you been doing today?
Nothing, just watching TV.
I'm really bored.
I don't have anything to do.
I don't have anything to do either.
I didn't do anything today except clean my house.
I know.
I was planning to go to the mall today with one of my friends, but it snowed so much we couldn't go anywhere.
I hope it snows all night because I don't want to go to school tomorrow.
Do you know anyone who has a camera?
I want to take a picture of all this snow.
No, I don't know anyone who has a camera.
Have you seen her today?
I think she might have one.
No, she hasn't been around all day.
She said she had something important to do today?
Oh, where did she go?
Nobody knows.
I called her roommate and she doesn't know either.
Did you know she called you?
No.
When did she call?
Two hours ago, I think.
Two hours ago?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
Sorry, I forgot.
What did she say?
She said she's waiting for you at her sister's place.
OK, I was going to cook dinner first, but I don't think I have enough time now.
I'll just warm up some leftovers in the microwave.
OK.
If she calls again tell her I'm gonna to be late.
OK, no problem.
This is very important.
Don't forget.
Don't worry.
I won't forget.
Actually, would you please hand me my phone?
I think I should give her a call now.
She's probably wondering where I am.
Sure, I'll get it for you.
I'm going shopping.
Do you want to come?
I thought you went shopping yesterday.
I did, but an old friend called me last night and invited me to his birthday party.
I need to buy a gift for him.
I see.
What are you going to get him?
I really have no idea what he likes.
I haven't seen him in a long time.
What do you think?
Maybe a cake?
That's a good idea, but I think I should probably get him something else, like something he can wear.
How about a sweater?
I saw a really nice one in the mall the other day.
Maybe we can go there and take a look.
OK, what store was it in?
It was at Macy's.
I think they're having a sale this weekend.
Oh, that's a really nice store.
I like the clothes there.
What are you doing here?
How are you?
I'm waiting for a friend.
I heard you're going to graduate this summer.
Is that true?
Yes.
If everything goes all right, I'll be getting my bachelors degree in August.
Then I need to start looking for a job.
I had to do that last year.
It wasn't easy.
Do you have any job offers?
No, not yet.
I sent out a lot of resumes, but I didn't receive many responses.
It's pretty hard to find a job right now.
What's your major?
Psychology.
That was my major when I started college, but I switched to engineering after the first year.
I think it's easier for engineers to find a job.
I'm not sure about that.
It took me about 3 months to find a job.
I finally was able to get a job after I put my resume on one of those job websites.
Anyway, it really doesn't matter.
If I can't find a job I'll probably go back to school to get my Masters degree.
What's up?
I haven't talked to you in a long time, what's been happening?
I don't know if you heard, I just moved into a new apartment in LA.
No, I heard you were thinking about moving but I didn't know you'd already found a place.
That's cool.
I'm really happy about it.
Do you have any roommates?
No, not this time.
It's a big change for me because I've never lived alone.
Don't you think you'll be lonely?
Not really, I have two friends who live in the same building.
We all had dinner together last night.
Are they students also?
No, they're not students, but there are a lot of students living in the building.
Sounds like a nice place.
I think it's a good environment for learning English.
I'm glad to hear everything worked out.
Well I'm glad that
You should come out here and visit me sometime.
There's even a pool.
That would be nice.
I'll think about it.
Have you found a girlfriend yet?
No, not yet.
What about her?
She has a boyfriend.
Oh, I thought they broke up.
No, they're still together.
How about that girl from work you were telling me about last year?
She's married now.
She got married last month.
I see.
It seems like everyone our age is married.
It's not easy.
Is there anyone you're interested in?
There is one girl I like who lives in my building.
I talk to her a lot because she's also studying English.
What's she like?
She's really nice.
She moved here from Texas about 3 months ago.
What does she do?
She's an accountant.
That's a good job.
She must be really smart.
Have you asked her out yet?
Actually we're going to dinner on Friday.
Good luck.
Sorry to bother you.
I have a question for you.
OK, what's up?
I've been having a problem with my computer.
I know you're an engineer so I thought you might be able to help me.
I see.
What's the problem?
I have a file that I can't open for some reason.
What type of file is it?
It's a Word document I've been working on.
I need to finish it by tomorrow.
Were you able to open it before, on the computer you're using now?
Yes, I was working on it last night and everything was fine, but this morning I couldn't open the file.
Do you think your computer might have a virus?
No, I checked and there weren't any.
OK.
I'm not sure what's wrong.
If it's possible, email the file to me and I'll see if I can get it to open.
OK, I'll do that when I get home.
Are you going to be around tonight?
I'll be home after 8 pm.
Send it to me when you get a chance and I'll call you later.
Do you know how to get downtown?
Sure.
Why are you going there?
I want to buy a new computer.
OK, are you driving?
Yes.
Go straight down this road.
When you get to the second light, take a left.
Then get on the highway and take exit 52.
That sounds really complicated.
Can you tell me again?
Which road do I take first?
You go down this road, then at the second light turn left.
That road is Main street.
OK, I think I've got it now.
Why are you buying a new computer anyway?
Didn't you just get one a few months ago?
Yes, but it doesn't work anymore.
Where did you buy it?
At Wal-Mart.
I think you're computer should still be under warranty.
You can bring it back to them and they'll fix it for free.
I think you're right.
I didn't think about that.
I should go talk to them about it.
Where is the closest Wal-Mart?
It's about 2 blocks from here.
I have to go there to get some stuff now anyway.
Do you want to follow me?
Sure.
Did you see the news today?
No, what happened?
There was a big earthquake in San Diego.
Oh my goodness.
The president was on the news talking about it earlier.
Was anyone hurt?
I think they said two people were killed.
Oh, that's terrible.
I can't believe you hadn't heard about it.
They were talking about it on CNN all day.
Oh, I don't watch TV that often.
Don't you watch the news?
No, I usually read the news online, but I haven't had time to turn on my computer today.
What's your favorite sport?
I like basketball.
I watch the games on TV all the time.
Who's your favorite team?
The Boston Celtics.
They're really good this year, aren't they?
Yes.
Do you like them?
Yes.
Everyone around here does.
Do you think they'll win the championship this year?
It's possible.
They have some really good players.
Did you watch the game last night?
A little, not the whole thing.
I watched the second half though and I saw some of the highlights online.
It was a great game, wasn't it?
Do you know who they're playing tomorrow night?
I think their playing LA.
That's going to be a tough game.
LA has a good team.
Are you working on your webpage now?
No, I'm still waiting for you to send me that image file for the homepage?
You mean you didn't get it?
I sent it to you over an hour ago.
Let me check.
It's going to take a second because I have to start up my computer.
OK.
Did you get it?
One second.
I just have to open my web browser and check my hotmail account.
OK.
OK, here it is.
I got it.
How do I find the webpage?
I tried to search for it on Yahoo but I couldn't find it.
Don't use Yahoo, use Google.
I tried that also and it didn't work.
If you go to Google and search for my name, you should be able to find it.
OK.
Let me try that.
I see it now.
I'm tired.
Would you mind driving for a while?
Sorry.
I would like to, but I don't know how to drive.
Really?
You don't have a license?
I thought everyone had a license.
No, I've lived in cities all my life and when I'm at home I usually take the subway or bus.
I see.
Do you think you'll learn to drive in the future?
Yes.
I plan to buy a car next year.
I think you need one in the U.S.
Actually, now that I think about it, a lot of people in cities here take the bus also.
I'd like to travel more.
I've been here for a few months already and I feel like I haven't seen anything yet.
How are you going to learn to drive?
Do you want me to teach you?
No, I wouldn't want to trouble you.
I've already signed up for a class near my house.
It starts next month.
Your English is so good.
How did you learn it?
In my country everyone has to take English starting in the first grade.
I've been taking English courses for 12 years now.
Wow, that's interesting.
I remember when we took that trip last year and visited your family.
It seemed like there weren't many people that could speak with me in English.
Oh, that's because they don't speak English that much.
But they speak it in school, right?
Maybe they just didn't like me so they didn't want to talk to me.
No, actually they liked you a lot.
They told me they thought you were very nice.
They are just shy.
They're not use to talking with foreigners.
I remember when I first came to the U.S.
I was really nervous about speaking with people.
I see.
I thought there were lots of Americans teaching English in your country.
Yes, that's true.
There are probably twice as many now as there were five years ago, but they are mostly in the cities.
My family lives in the country.
I wonder why.
Personally I prefer the country to the city.
It's so quiet and peaceful.
If I were to teach, I would want to teach in the country.
Do you think you would want to teach someday?
I know the schools around my town are looking for teachers, so if you want I can call them and get more information.
No, I don't think so.
I would need to stay there for a year, and I don't think I can take that much time off work.
If you change your mind, let me know.
I think you would be a really great teacher.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Oh yes, it's almost Christmas, isn't it.
I'm not sure what I'll be doing then.
If you don't have any plans, your family could have dinner at my house.
That's very nice of you, thanks.
Have you finished your shopping yet?
No, I still have to do that.
I think I'll go to the mall this weekend.
It's going to be really crowded at the mall.
You should shop online.
You're right.
My family loves to read, so I can probably get them all presents from Amazon.com.
What do you think you'll get for your wife?
Probably a romance novel.
It seems like she's always reading one of those.
Don't you think you should get her something a little more expensive, like jewelry or maybe a new computer?
Maybe you're right.
It's hard buying gifts.
I think my wife has everything she wants.
Maybe I should just ask her.
Who are you going to vote for?
I'm not sure yet.
You should make up your mind soon.
The election is next month.
Yes, I know.
I hear about it every day on the news.
I'm going to vote for her.
I think he is a good choice.
I know.
They're both good.
It's hard to decide.
He is older but he has more experience.
He seems to have a lot of good ideas.
It's hard to know what the truth is.
That's the reason I really don't pay attention to politics.
Yes, it can be frustrating, but it's important and it's interesting to watch.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure, what's up?
I wanted to let you know about a book club I joined a couple months ago.
I know you do a lot of reading so I thought you might want to come with me next month.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
When does the group meet?
Usually the last Saturday of the month at 9:30 in the evening.
Is that too late for you?
No, I think that's OK.
What do you talk about in the group?
Every month we choose a new book and then during the next meeting we discuss it.
What book are you reading now?
The Kite Runner.
I've heard that's a good book.
What's it about?
It is a good book.
I'm almost finished.
The book is about a boy who grows up in Afghanistan during the 1980s.
It's called the Kite Runner because the main character takes part in a kite flying competition.
That sounds really interesting.
I'd love to come.
Ok, great.
The next meeting isn't for another two weeks, so you still have time to read the book.
